   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase access to safe, inclusive and quality education for school-aged children and adolescents in Jabel Saman (Eastern side of Aleppo city) and Haritan sub-district, Aleppo.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Action aims at increasing access to improved and protective education services provision for the most vulnerable resident population and returnees living in newly accessible areas of Jabel Saman and Haritan sub-districts. The proposal is in line with the Fund&#x2019;s Strategic Objective 1 (Provide lifesaving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs), Sector&#x2019; Specific Objectives and SRP Strategic Objectives, responding to life-sustaining needs in underserved, high severity areas (ranked 5 and 6 by the Education severity scale), including those that are newly accessible, addressing critical gaps and expanding coverage to areas of highest need, and meeting the needs of particularly vulnerable groups, especially children and those living with disabilities.
Firstly, the Action will increase access to learning spaces by providing protected, safe and friendly environment as immediate term response through:
 Provision of Non-Formal Education services (Catch-up/Remedial classes) targeting poorly performing children at risk of drop-out in need of specific educational support to recover their gaps, exacerbated by education disruption due to Covid-19 related measures. 
 Enhancement of education facilities: rehabilitate classrooms, provide school furniture, improve and rehabilitate gender-sensitive and inclusive WASH facilities.
 Provision of education supplies for both students and teachers by stationery (School in a Box kits), school bags and teaching materials to mitigate the financial load of targeted beneficiaries. 
Secondly, the Action will increase quality of education services supporting children&#x2019;s well-being in immediate and mid-term response by:
 Education personnel professional development on child-centered and protective pedagogy (PSS) and life skills education.
 Schools-based life-skills and PSS support for children, accompanying them all across the Action.

The total number of direct beneficiaries is 4,765 individuals, including 4,600 children (2,760 G and 1,840 B), and 165 teachers (99 F, 66 M).
The intervention will be implemented and continuously monitored/evaluated by GVC staff, based on its long-standing presence in Aleppo governorate and strong relations with the authorities involved in the activities. Based on the existing MoU with the Ministry of Education (MoE), the whole Action has been discussed end preliminary endorsed by the MoE and Directorate of Education (DoE), including the hard component (rehabilitation of schools and distribution of furniture and school materials) and soft component (training of teachers, NFE program and life-skills activities for children). Schools have been identified through a GVC preliminary assessment and indications from DoE, while beneficiaries for the soft component will be selected according to vulnerability criteria set in close consultation with DoE (women teachers&#x2019; will be prioritized for capacity building, while weaker children will be identified through placement tests before catch-up classes). 
GVC will also coordinate with SARC, as per existing MoU, for the implementation of PSS school-based activities. At field level, the activity will be coordinated with a pool of SARC volunteers previously trained by GVC in the framework on an ongoing project funded by the Italian Cooperation Agency.
The whole Action will be conducted adopting safe measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including distribution of hand sanitizer and face masks for school personnel and educators, and awareness sessions for children in catch-up classes delivered by teachers and GVC staff. GVC Engineer and Education team will constantly monitor the hard and soft components of the Action through a robust monitoring and reporting system, ensuring quality and consistency of the implemented interventions, while coordinating with DoE and other actors intervening in same and nearby areas.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Qualitative education services to children in Rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project AlTamayoz will support the most vulnerable children in Rural Damascus with comprehensive qualitative education services as a response to the urgent education needs of boys and girls from different communities (IDPs, returnees and host community) in this area.  
Project specific locations will be: Duma, Harasta, and Ein Tarma where AlTamayoz has existing operational presence and considered as a trustworthy NGO in Rural Damascus because of the several qualitative services it provides to people.
AlTamayoz is now running an education project under SHF 2019 in 4 locations, the actual work on the ground showed the huge need for education services which exceeded our expectations, therefore, part of this project will be as a continuation of the activities in 2 locations (Duma and Harasta &#x2013; severity scale:4) to enable more children benefit from the essential services. A new center will be in Ein Tarma where the severity scale is 5. 
This project is planned to start in November 2020 due to the time needed to get the necessary approvals, and this will make part of this project run in parallel with the currently running project, during this period the activities will be implemented in 2 shifts and will target different students to avoid duplication. Implementing the new activities in facilities already operational will help benefiting from the already existing furniture and equipment and will support sustainability. during the period where the 2 projects are implemented at the same time, the activities will be conducted in a manner that prevent overlapping or duplication, activities will be implemented in the same place but at different time, they will be as a second shift and will target new students and parents who are not supported by the ongoing project, this will be monitored through data cross checking and data exchange.
Activities will include:
Providing children under 5 years with early childhood education, and recreational activities.
Support children (5-17) years with non-formal education (remedial classes, catch-up classes, accelerating learning program), school supplies, psychosocial support, life skills and citizenship education program, and recreational activities.
Provide teachers and education staff with capacity building training.
Conduct awareness raising sessions to parents and children about the importance of education, and about COVID-19
Conduct back to learn campaigns in 3 locations.
Through this project, AlTamayoz will target  27560  beneficiaries (Students, parents, and education actors) 
Project activities will target boys and girls in addition to their parents, this will enhance the effectiveness of education activities and increase parents awareness about the importance of their children education. 
Project activities will be implemented in a free of violence atmosphere, Do No Harm will be one the most principles applied during implementation. Most teachers will be female to avoid any risk of GBV during implementation, in addition, a well trained PSS provider will be in each center to provide the needed psychosocial support and to observe any cases related to GBV and refer them to the specialist.
Project will assure active participation of students with disability, a special person will be available to support them in each center, assisstive devices (crutches, walker,..) will be available to the most vulnerable, a good coordinate with other actors in the area will be in place to support them with other special services (hearing aids, enunciation sessions,...)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rehabilitation of market in Rural Aleppo Dayr Hafir</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rescate team was exerting endeavors to respond to the 1st standard allocation objective (2) support mitigation of the socio-economic impacts stemming from economic and financial crisis in addition to restrictive measures to prevent COVID-19. Rescate based its studies on the ERL activities and indicators, as the sector has identified the following objectives for the planned intervention: 
Improve access to basic and social services and infrastructure B. Strengthen access to livelihoods by creating income-generating opportunities and by improving access to production and market infrastructure to restore local economy recovery. Hence, Rescate has visited several locations stated in the ERL priority areas to build its intervention in line with needs expressed by communities. The intervention is planning to respond to lifesaving needs for a market in Dayr Hafir in response to the emergency needs of the community to have a market which will ensure organization, services WASH and electricity, cleanliness, especially that the City Council lately established a market after four years of delay, but the municipality has received criticism from the city&apos;s residents due to the lack of services, so it was abandoned by sellers due to creating traffic jams, lack of services especially cleanliness.
Rescate has set the plan in coordination with the city council, the municipality and the community leaders including women and PWDs who are working in the streets at the Martyrs roundabout to secure minimum living costs, stated two sellers a woman and an adolescent with disability. Rescate has a written approval from the city council stating the needs and readiness to immediately start implementation of the project subject to fund availability (attached with translation). The location is decided, studies about the nearby public services are identified (water, sanitation, electricity, and cleanliness measures were conducted to decide on the infrastructure rehabilitation levels. A detailed BOQ is prepared with market studies for costs, the location scheme is prepared including facilities for 9 types of sales professions. The project aims at securing 50/50 male-female shares, the Market Committee have women represented. The socio-economic study result show women have a fundamental role in the rural areas because they work in the back scene in these areas on farming, livestock husbandry and dairy products in addition to preparing legume and fruits for sale (packaging, bundles, dried herbs and sweets, and syrups etc.). Therefore rehabilitation the market per say will create an optimum place to display their products, hence will positively impact on their production and will improve their income. During consultations and the community involvement in designing the project, women were represented and wanted their males to be in the front-line and work at the market so they work back to back, &#x201C;extracted from eventual meetings&#x201D;. The market committee will be encouraged to persuade that each stand will have females to work with males at site because each stand requires two individuals to run it, women will be encouraged to share the work at the stands so they guarantee direct income and freedom to benefit from their work. 

Rescate is committed to submit 4Ws and reports to cover progress and achievements, MampE, financial and narrative reports to the sector and donors. Rescate coordinates with DINGO to ensure no duplication of services amongst the acting partners.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Empowering the vulnerable people in western and northern rural Hama.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the frequent displacement and return in the Soran district and the new return to Kafr Zita, the unemployment rate increased as well as regular income reduced, which led some families to resort to harmful coping mechanisms, such as child labor, to meet the expenses of their needs. 

Furthermore, the risks of the spread of the new Coronavirus in Syria have prompted measures aimed at limiting the movement of citizens to prevent the spread of the virus. Although, these measures aimed to reduce the spread of the virus, but at the same time it has created a humanitarian crisis for vulnerable families whose sources of financial income were suspended. 

According to the SCS latest assessments at the beginning of 2020, there are (5800 families) in Suran and (280 families) in Kafar Zita. Thereby, in this six-month-project, SCS proposes to meet the emergency needs of 500 returned, displaced and host beneficiaries in Soran and Kafr Zita districts in rural Hama. Women headed households will be given preferential treatment including youth and household heads with physical disability. 

To support beneficiaries, SCS will employ two programmes: (1) Vocational Training (VT) to support 500 beneficiaries and (2) Start-up Small Business Projects grants (SSBP) using in-kind assistance as a modality to support 38 households (190 individuals). Thus, the project will contribute to increase the level of self-reliance and reduce dependence on aid by developing the capabilities of vulnerable people.

Social Care Society is one of the leader NGOs in Hama that has practiced humanitarian work in providing Protection, WASH, Health, Education and Livelihoods  services since 2013. In 2017-2018, SCS implemented a multi-section projects, called Ataa project (in cooperation with UNICEF) and Helm project (in cooperation with UNHCR). These projects were able to emergency respond to the returnees to Northern Rural Hama. SCS was able overreached its target numbers to 6,000 community members in livelihoods  programs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-Sectoral Support through Multi-Purpose Cash for Vulnerable Households in Nashabiyeh sub-district in Douma, rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The protracted crisis coupled with the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid devaluation of the SYP has further exacerbated humanitarian needs for already vulnerable communities in Syria. Price inflation of food as well as non-food items has had a serious deteriorating effect compelling people to engage in increasingly negative coping mechanisms. Those hardest hit by the difficult socio-economic conditions are vulnerable communities in under-served locations with high severity needs. This project aims to prevent a further deterioration of living conditions as well as restore dignified living conditions for vulnerable people through a multi-sector approach using Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance (MPCA). This project will target  Nashabiyeh sub-district in Douma, Rural Damascus (severity score of 4). 2,000 Cash transfers to be made via a regulated financial service provider are targeted at 2,000 households (HHs) -at least 10,000 direct beneficiaries with a frequency of three transfers per household- once a month. The transfer value amount of 100,000 SYP is in line with the recommended amounts by the Syria Cash Working Group (approx. 50% of the June 2020 MEB gap). Priority will be given to persons living with disabilities, elderly persons, people with chronic illness and injuries, female headed households and people facing extreme socio-economic hardship with considerations made for households who have lost or had their livelihoods means disrupted due to COVID-19. The project is designed offer optimal dignity, flexibility and efficiency for the most vulnerable households.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ensure immediate and consistent access to food to the most vulnerable and food insecure people in Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nine years into the crisis, the current food security situation in Syria has deteriorated significantly compared to 2019. COVID-19 is exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in Syria - particularly for the most vulnerable. The most deprived families are fully reliant on external assistance. Recent assessments by WFP (June 2020) indicate the price of the reference food basket is SYP 84,095, representing an increase of 48% compared to May 2020. The national average food basket is now 23.5 times higher than the pre-crisis level.  The average for June 2020 (SYP 84,095) is now more expensive than the highest-paid official government monthly salary of SYP 80,240 outlining the serious deterioration of purchasing power in Syria over the last 8 months. In October 2019, WFP&#x2019;s national average reference food basket was SYP 25,424.
Taking into consideration the 2020 1st standard allocation and the needs identified in the field, AAH will focus on improving access to food in order to mitigate and respond to the socio-economic impacts of the on-going crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic on the most food insecure people in Syria.
The project will address the immediate needs of vulnerable and crisis-affected populations by providing    life-saving food parcels (coherent with the FSL cluster indicators) to 2,000 Households.
Immediate provision of food parcels will not only save lives but will help beneficiaries avoid recourse to secondary negative coping mechanisms, exacerbating already existing vulnerabilities and COVID-19 risks. 
This project will be implemented in Aleppo governorate, estimated to have one of the highest levels of needs.  The proposed targeted sub districts  (Hadher, Zarbah, Jebel Saman, Hreitan and Atareb) have been identified with high severity scores and the severity level in these subdistricts as major severity. 
AAH always looks for complementarity between projects therefore, AAH will provide food-assistance/parcels to the same beneficiaries as the AAH ongoing project with another grant (covering two months of food-assistance/parcels) to support the immediate needs of those most-at-risk &#x2013; defined as individuals who are unable to access and purchase a basic food intake. 
Under this project, the distribution of food parcels (one in November and a second in December) will be undertaken in close coordination and collaboration with SARC, which is responsible for community food parcel distribution. 
 Beneficiaries of the project are approximately 12,000 individuals of returnees. 
The proposed project mainstreams and incorporates protection principles in the activities to promote meaningful access, safety and dignity. AAH is capitalizing on lessons learnt and best practices from other interventions and considers Sphere standards, Food Security Sector best practices, WHO and cluster guidance on responses to COVID 19. 
Despite the challenging environment, AAH has full-access to the targeted areas through SARC and has the capacity to initiate operations according to the work-plan established through direct-implementation. 
Particular attention has been paid to ensure activities implemented by AAH are not a duplication of activities undertaken by other agencies in the area and complement activities from other actors.
AAH attended a coordination meeting with other INGOs based in Damascus, which applies to the OCHA_SHF call for proposals in order to ensure no duplication of proposed locations and activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of multi-purpose cash assistance to vulnerable households in Rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DRC is proposing to provide multipurpose cash assistance (MPCA) to 1,000 HHs (6,000 vulnerable individuals of six family average size) in the Rural Damascus Qudsiya sub-district to cover their basic needs.
According to the HNO 2020, Rural Damascus is one of the five Governorates with more IDPs and returnees and Qudisya is one of the sub-districts with higher food insecurity rates as stated by  the Food Sector. Only WFP, UNHCR and UNRWA are providing CVA in Qudisya and the accessibility to functioning markets and FSPs make the MPCA the most suitable intervention to address the basic needs of vulnerable HHs. The 1,000 HHs will be selected in coordination with the main NGOs working in the area as well as the local authorities among the most vulnerable and underserved populations. The target has been set based on the number of families in the waiting lists of WFP, the  capacity of the local markets and FSP, the project implementation timeframe, and the budget availability.

Based on the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) figure provided by the Cash Working Group(CWG) and harmonization efforts made with INGOs, DRC will provide 100,000 SYP cash assistance every month with a total of 600,000 SYP transferred per HH during the length of the response (6 payments of 100,000 SYP every month). DRC will aim to maintain harmonization with the agreed CWG rate. In case the CWG decides to change the transfer rate, during the project, DRC will communicate to SHF the proposed new rate before making any changes. It is expected that if the rate were to change it would coincide with a change in the FX rate and so would be able to be funded via a currency gain. 

The project will be implemented directly by DRC in Qudsiya, where has been present for 10 years and is already carrying out economic recovery interventions. This will allow DRC to target particularly HHs with compounding vulnerabilities, including those facing protection concerns and those with members who are socially and economically marginalized and in need of assistance, such as women-headed households, people with disabilities, and elderlies. The beneficiary selection will be coordinated with WFP, who is providing food assistance to the most vulnerable HHs in the area. WFP will share their beneficiary lists with DRC to avoid overlapping and to provide a coordinated response in the target area. 

DRC received written approval from MoSAL to implement cash-based interventions (CBI) on April 21st, 2020. Since then, DRC has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), beneficiary selection tools, and guidelines conducted a monthly risk analysis and provided training for national staff. DRC has also received approval to implement an MPCA project in Dara&#xB4;a that is currently ongoing through other funds.

DRC has signed a framework agreement with a financial service provider (FSP) and held several coordination meetings to confirm their capacity to absorb the caseload and their commitment to follow COVID-19 prevention measures and humanitarian principles</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent support for returnees affected by the Covid-19 and the protracted crisis in Al-Ghab region/Hama governorate to improve their food and nutrition security through livelihoods restoration.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AlGhab region which is part of Hama governorate is composed of three districts (Muhardeh, As-Squielbieh, Mesiaf). These districts were affected by the protracted crisis in various levels. FAO is proposing to improve food and nutrition security of 5,750 returnee families affected in Muhardeh district. The district of Muhardeh was the most affected in the region due to the challenging and complex security situation and its proximity to a previous intense military operation area. Since the crisis erupted, at least 60% of the population in Muhardeh district were affected. In some villages, rural households were displaced several times. With an improvement of the security situation, some families are returning to their original villages. Though barriers to return still exist, an estimated 50% of the displaced population have actually returned to their lands but they need support to rebuild their livelihood. 

The main income source for rural families is agriculture (crops and livestock) and marketing of agricultural products. This means that to assist returnees achieve household-level food and nutrition security, it is important to support them through agriculture-based livelihoods restoration. In a study conducted by FAO in 2020 (Al-Ghab baseline), about 50% of people in Al-Ghab region (including Muhardeh) have reported that the main difficulty they are facing is the lack of access to good quality and price increase of inputs due to the exchange rate fluctuations and closure of the borders due to Covid-19 related restrictive measures. Another 34% of the people in the region have reported that they had to stop summer crop production due to lack of water access mainly caused by the damage / destruction of main and field irrigation networks, and the destruction to the wells in the region particularly in Muhardeh. Moreover, livestock numbers in Muhardeh has dropped significantly by 26% since the beginning of the crisis.

FAO is therefore proposing a 12-months intervention in Muhardeh district , which will target 5,750 households (34,500 individuals) through quick-impact activities, which will support wheat and livestock production coupled with the rehabilitation of field irrigation networks and systems. The wheat production component will target 3,250 returnee households through provision of quality wheat seed and support with land preparation the livestock production component will target 1,500 returnee households and IDPs through distribution of animal feed. To address the water challenges, FAO proposes to rehabilitate essential irrigation infrastructure to restore 800 hectares of irrigable land, which will benefit 1,000 households. In selecting Muhardeh for this proposed intervention, FAO has taken into account the prevalence of food insecurity among returnees as a result of constraints related to lack of access to crop production inputs, livestock feed and water for crop production. The area was also prioritized within the Standard Allocation Strategy Paper and coordination has been done within the food and agriculture sector (FAS) and with the Early Recovery and Livelihoods (ERL) sector to ensure that there is no duplication and overlap.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Community Primary Health Care services for vulnerable population though a mobile unit network in Hama Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian needs in underserved areas remain critical across different Governorates of Syria in the second semester of 2020.The Introduction of SARS-CoV-2, causing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), into Syria has resulted in the need for scaling up detection and tracing capacity for COVID-19 to assist in understanding the transmission and epidemiology of the disease at Governorate, districts, and subdistrict jurisdictionslevel. At the same time, equally important, the imperative of health sector partners led by WHO is to ensure continuity of quality essential PHC services, a paramount priority in the INTERSOS approach to resilience in Syria.

The present proposal is inspired by the HNO and Health Sector priorities 2020, and abides by the criteria of SHF standard allocation 2020. Over 12 months proposed project duration, the INTERSOS Community Health Care (CHC) approach, - translated from the Arabic Da&#x2019;am Al- Mujtama&#x2019;a Sehiyyan - aims to offer humanitarian assistance to underserved areas and vulnerable groups in selected districts and sub-districts of Hama and Rural Damascus governorates based on 4 overarching objectives. The project focus is to cover areas of high severity score gt3 with (i) Support to outreach PHC services delivered by Mobile Health Units (MHUs) and support long-term, sustainable access to essential health care services in rural locations of northern Hama and Rural Damascus. The success of an integrated mobile clinic approach in several areas of Syria shows that maintaining or expanding outreach in areas where IDP and returnee groups without access to primary health care live would allow more effective coverage of most vulnerable segments, including persons living with disability. Furthermore, (ii) A robust set of capacity development programme will ensure IPC training of health providers, triage capacity, and communication for behavioural change within the RCCS framework. Rural areas (iii) will be provided by reliable and quality medical supplies and commodities, PPE, and basic equipment, and, finally, the project will ensure (iv) awareness raising in the population though risk communication and community engagement by spreading positive messages of positive family practices, protective behaviour and COVID-19 prevention messages through a dedicated, dynamic, well-trained and area-specific social mobilization network. While measures such as social distancing, movement restrictions  and the closure of  selected institutions like schools or workplaces may be still necessary to contain the disease transmission, the pandemic in Syria can only be controlled through early case detection, contact tracing, rapid testing, isolation, and treatment. The social mobilization in Hama areas will contribute to active case search of presumtpive COVID-19 cases.

A project monitoring and learning framework will enable INTERSOS and partners to appreciate outputs, limitations and needs for mid-course correction at district and sub-district level. In Hama, project implementation and coordinated project reviews will be supervised by SARC and helped supported by INTERSOS specialists. INTERSOS will ensure regular follow up, reporting and information sharing with partners by using Health Sector existing channels, formal procedures and established mechanisms</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the priorities of the health sector of 2020 and the presence of cases of patients with Virus
Covid 19 there is a crucial need to support the provision of essential package of health care  and mental health services on a wide scale, therefore Shabab Alkhear Charity will strengthen the provision of the basic package of
health care and  health services  in the (Tel Zubaydah) eastern countryside of Homs through a medical point that includes three clinics (internal - gynecology - children) health services will support women - children - youth , people living with disability and the elderly.
The village is about 16 km away from the city of Homs. the population drink well water and there is no sanitation in the village so this creates the risk of disease spreading . In addition,there is no health center or Primary health care services. the population have to travel to Homs city when they need primary health services , This is difficult for pregnant women, especially because the village does not have a gynecological clinic and it is also difficult for children and the elderly because there is no pediatric clinic or internal medicine . There is only a dentist and a pharmacy in the village of Tal Zubaydah, and it needs to provide primary and secondary health services .The population of Tal Zubaydah is 2700, including 1150 displaced people, the medical point will support the village of Tel Zubaydah and the neighboring villages such as Al-Fahayla, which includes 3000 people - Jumailiya includes 3000 people - Tel Al-Sheeh includes 2000 people- Tel AL-Naqh includes 5000 people . The medical point will support  Primary health care services including medical consultations , Lab tests, X-ray, Echo and distribution of medicines. This point will support  secondary services (C.T Scan- M.R.I-ophthalmology surgeries-orthopaedic surgeries) . Trauma care services (fractures surgeries - minor emergency surgeries and treatment ) will be supported by this point basing on medical referral to one of the  hospitals in Homs city and support the assistive devices ( Medical glasses- Hearing aids ) will be supported by this point basing on medical referral to one of the  hospitals in Homs city  . 
The medical point  will operate for 6 hours daily under the project

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing and promoting primary and secondary health care services to the most vulnerable groups and areas in Aleppo  its countryside</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The country is still living in a difficult stage under the current conditions, especially in light of the difficult economic conditions, poor living, high prices and the difficulty in providing primary and secondary health care services, and this requires providing a response to this, especially for the most vulnerable populations such as (the elderly, women, persons with disabilities, and the returnees ...) especially in the rural areas of Aleppo, noting the recent rise in the newly infected people with corona virus (COVID 19) in the country, and this is a burden and a challenge for people.
This project aims to strengthen the health sector in the countryside of Aleppo by providing primary and secondary health care services and to increase the access of health services to hard-to-reach areas through mobile medical clinics for the most vulnerable areas and social groups in coordination with Aleppo Health Directorate.
The medical services that will be provided are providing health care services to about 23000 beneficiaries (in Aleppo amp its countryside) by two mobile clinics that have been pre-equipped with SHF funding with medical devices such as: ECG, Echograghy, portable X-Ray device.
They include four medical specialties: internal clinic, gynecological clinic, pediatric clinic, and orthopedic clinic.
In addition to having a highly qualified medical staff to deal with patients, and have previous experience working within mobile medical teams.
Thus equipped mobile clinics will give us a quick start in providing primary health care services, in addition to reduce the movement of beneficiaries between the countryside and the city, and thus enhance the role of social divergence to reduce COVID-19 pandemic.

The medical services that will be provided are:
1) Primary health care services:
	Providing patients with drugs and medical analysis.
	Awareness sessions and psychological support  for the beneficiaries (such as: Corona virus).
	Investigations: ECHO, ECG, X-Ray.
	Wheelchairs for the disabled.
	Hearing Aids.
	Medical Glasses....
2) Secondary health care services, such as:
	Deliveries.
	General surgeries.
	Orthopedic operations.
	Gynecological operations.
	Urinary surgeries...
Through the system of referrals from the countryside to the city to implement the required action.

The areas were carefully selected in coordination with Aleppo Health Directorate and WHO, where Aleppo Health Directorate indicated to us that the health services in these areas are insufficient and the areas urgently need the medical services that were set in the project proposal (especially radiography and analyses...), noting that there are some health centers in those areas, but only provide vaccination services for children.
As for the criteria to be used in selecting regions:
The criteria used for selecting areas were based on the priorities of Aleppo Health Directorate in terms of the areas most in need of providing medical services? and according to the following criteria:
 The absence of hospitals to provide secondary health care services, such as surgeries and others.
 The lack of pharmacies in the targeted areas.
 The lack of sufficiently specialized medical clinics to provide inspections and investigations.
 Population groups in those areas are among the most vulnerable groups.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As Syria enters its tenth year of crisis, the scale, severity, and complexity of needs across Syria remain deep and far-reaching. Over half of the country&#x2019;s population have fled their homes: 5.5 million people have sought refuge in the region and beyond, and 6.1 million people are internally displaced. 13.1 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance. More than eight in10 people in Syria live below poverty line. Many people&#x2019;s coping mechanisms are depleted, and families face hard choices to put food on the table, a roof over their heads, keeping their children warm or sending them to school
In2020, with conflict still raging in parts of the country, and the COVID-19 pandemic expected to result in severe economic and social impact, humanitarian needs are projected to continue to grow

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing health services for people in need in rural of Homs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The crisis in Syria is in its 9th year now, Due to the crisis, the economic situation of the people became very weak and their ability to pay for the costs of their basic needs especially the costs related to secondary health services which could be some times a life saving services.
The Syrian people now are also facing the effects of the global pandemic (COVID-19) on their economy, the costs of the health services became very high in comparison with the average income of the Syrian people and could reach 5 times their monthly income for the simplest medical surgery. While putting the spotlight on this severe needs in the community, we want to focus on the needs in the health sector in the eastern and northern rural of Homs.
Since Al-Birr Association is a main actor in the health sector specially in Homs city and its rural, we notice the huge gap between the financial ability for people and the costs of the health services. Al-Birr is already providing health services to people in need through its medical centers and hospitals with minimal prices and also covers the costs of the health services for people through referrals for people that are most in need. But due to the weak financial situation to people and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic situation, the numbers of people in need and requesting for referrals from the association are getting significantly larger and the financial abilities of the association can&apos;t cover the needs of people. 
Al-Birr has medical centers which are spread in Homs city and its eastern and northern rural area. In addition, Al-Birr is operating Al-Kindi Hospital and own Al-Birr Hospital in Homs and they are both serving a large number of people in need in Homs and its rural.
Al-Birr is looking forward to respond to the rising needs of the people related to secondary health services especially the life saving ones such as cardiac operations in cooperation with SHF.
The project aims at covering the gap we&apos;ve noticed through our health centers, hospitals and referral office of the Association, where it&apos;s clear that there is a lack of financial ability of people to cover their needs of health service through referral mechanism to people in need to do the medical operations they need in the hospitals they choose and the Association will cover the expenses of their operations through the fund provided by SHF for the project.
The project is mainly directed to the people in need in northern rural areas of Homs in (Talbissah, Rastan, Houla) since they&apos;re areas of high severity of needs. In addition, it will be directed to areas in eastern rural of Homs with high severity of needs (Qaryateen-Forqlos) and the returnees to Tadmor and the IDPs and returnees from Rukban who settled in different areas in Homs city and its northern and eastern of Homs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SARC&#x2019;s integrated response to save lives and minimize the overall impacts of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality to the most vulnerable communities in Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SARC has developed a COVID Response Plan and has already started specific COVID-19 preparedness work, in particular with a mass sterilization campaign of the streets and public areas of Damascus, Al-Hassakeh, Aleppo, Homs, Deir-Ez-Zour and Daraa as well as a mass awareness raising campaigns using existing bill boards and community-based first aid (CBHFA) programme. The SARC COVID response plan focuses on preparedness, containment, mitigation and early recovery using SARC&#x2019;s existing programmes that have been implemented throughout the Syrian conflict such as providing medical and food assistance to those most in need.
Under the plan SARC has put in place measures to ensure the continuity of essential health care and WASH services targeting the most vulnerable populations including communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the SARC business continuity plan. The plan prioritizes increased protection of SARC volunteers who put their health and lives at risk in the course of delivering services to affected people.
The proposed response is to reduce community transmission, morbidity and mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and increase human dignity to affected communities in Syria through an integrated and gender-responsive approach focusing on health, WASH and psychosocial support and building on the already established SARC partnerships between SARC and RCRC Movement Partners, UN agencies and the international non-governmental organizations. The response is very much in line with the priorities identified in SARC&#x2019;s COVID Response Plan and the technical clusters in Syria, the strategic priorities of SARC and global COVID response strategies. For this project SARC will target communities who are most vulnerable to COVID infection and first responders particularly in those governorates where the MoH has identified positive cases and those communities in IDPs camps and collective shelters in Aleppo, Al-Hasakah, Hama, Homs, Deraa, Damascus and Rural Damascus. 
Specifically, and to ensure a rapid, efficient, and coordinated response by the SARC health teams, key activities in the proposed action will focus on the following:
 Provision and distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to SARC volunteers and staff providing services in SARC health facilities comprising of Primary Health Clinics (PHC), Mobile Health Units (MHU), Emergency Health Points (EHP), Mobile Medical Teams (MMT), First Aid Centers and Ambulance Services.
 Community hygiene promotion activities as part of a broader risk communication and community engagement strategy.

The above will be complemented by SARC&#x2019;s ongoing activities including training of SARC health volunteers and staff on epidemic control to ensure they are better prepared to respond to health in emergencies and epidemic control.
Through these activities the project aims to achieve the following:
 Increase the capacity of 1,950 SARC health volunteers and staff to provide high quality preventative and promotive health services in SARC health facilities 
 Enhance the capacity of SARC&#x2019;s 126 health facilities comprising of emergency health points (EHPs), clinics, mobile health units (MHUs), medical teams (MMTs), first aid centers and ambulances to deliver and track health services with a focus on COVID-19</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing essential nutrition services to vulnerable communities in Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project addresses the immediate and mid-term nutritional needs of women and children in Syria with a special focus on the rural areas of Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Daraa, Deir Ezour, Sweida Lattakia, Qunaitra and Rural Damascus. The priorities are early detection and treatment of severe acute malnutrition and the prevention of acute Malnutrition. The detection of acute malnutrition will be done through MUAC measurements to Children U5 and pregnant lactating women as advised in UNICEF published wasting program protocol which has been endorsed by Nutrition sector and the Ministry of Health.
The service will be delivered mainly through 2 national NGOs with the use of MOH infrastructure to maximize the reach as much as possible.
Cash will be transferred to 2 NGOs (SFPA and Al Ihsan Charity Association) while the supplies will be provided to the beneficiaries through both NGOs and MOH service delivery points.
Both NGOs already have a huge network of volunteers and infrastructure and a good reputation in program implementation
Total population covered through this support will be 158,589 women and children including women and children with disabilities.
To ensure quality UNICEF will procure the required nutrition supplies and distribute to intended sites through partners in intended sites to reach the most vulnerable population. 
Capacity building will be an integral part of the project where NGOs and community volunteers will be trained-contributing in resilience building.

Two of the major impacts of COVID-19 pandemic are the movement restrictions and social/physical distancing, which affected the monitoring, supervision, paper-based reporting and capacity building activities which will defiantly be resulted in a low quality of service.  Hence, another core component of this project comes to address this challenge The enhancement of digital platform of around 130 CMAM centers and 14 trainings venues all over the country. The plan is to i) to equip 14 training/meeting venues in the governorate centers with ICT set of equipment/tools to be used for trainings at the governorate level and to allow participants to attend remote/virtual training/workshops/meetings as well.  ii) To provide each CMAM center with a set of ICT equipment/tools to facilitate virtual meetings, capacity building activities and information management. Another advantage of this digital platform is that it will enable the service provider to track tracking of SAM cases individual which will increase the quality of care and quality of reports as well. 

 This project will be completed in one year.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promoting the Alternative Care services for most vulnerable children affected by on-going emergencies in Damascus city and its rural surrounding.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this project is to promote and increase awareness about the Alternative Care services for children in Child and Youth Friendly Language among 20,100 children, caregivers in addition to humanitarian workers in Damascus city and it&#x2019;s rural. 
Children and adolescents in alternative care or may become separated from their families face the risk of abuse, neglect, and child rights violations. They often think they do not have the same rights as others.
The project aims at raising their awareness about their right to live in a supportive family environment. It explains what needs to happen to children who cannot live with their parents or are at risk of being separated from them.
The project focus on highlighting the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, which outline standards of care and protection for our target group which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2009.
The awareness session will focus on speaking directly to the children and youth through the following content:
Children&#x2019;s right to care and protection- children&#x2019;s rights when parents face difficulties, when children cannot live with your parents and when there is an emergency in child&#x2019;s country
The project will also target children with special needs who have challenges to read and understand the booklet. The project team will explain the contents of the booklet through real-life examples or simple games. 
Target groups: Children and youth benefiting from SOS children&apos;s villages&apos; programs and local NGO partners including children who need special care. Children who live in alternative care programs run by local charities, Children, and families who face the risk of family separation, Care providers and humanitarian workers, Children in public school, and Community committees (10 communities).
The project also aims at providing group psychological support to 5000 of the project beneficiaries. The intervention will help discharge beneficiaries&#x2019; emotions and promote the psychosocial well-being of children and their psychosocial safety.
The project will include also risk education sessions for all the project beneficiaries. The goal is to educate them about the danger of mines and remnants of war that could endanger their lives. Using officially approved brochure provided by UNMAS, this awareness will help them remain safe in the areas in which they live or upon their return to their cities and areas from which they were displaced during the crisis.
Moreover, the project aims at supporting most vulnerable children from the project beneficiaries in the targeted communities who face the risk of losing their parental care due to risks of their family separation (100 families or 500 beneficiaries). 
These risks are caused by the protection and socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 and knock-on effects on the economy caused by the unstable exchange rate and other factors that have been observed in SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages programs&#x2019; locations in Damascus vicinity,
The project will also focus on preventing family separation and contributing to restore the local economy recovery by providing financial support for families through 7 months of cash assistance to protect families from negative coping mechanisms impacting children which include separating children from the family. These actions will be supported by a group of activities specially designed to increase access for children and families to quality child protection interventions in targeted locations through psycho-social counselling, case management, and awareness sessions related to parental care.
Moreover, the families will be supported through the wide connection channels of SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages Syria with partners. Also, they will be referred to other NGOs that provide support based on their identified needs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing resilience of Palestine refugees in Syria through the provision of protection and community services</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at supporting the protective environment of Palestine refugee populations at risk and it will address their protection needs arising as consequences of the of the conflict, COVID-19 and the public health preventive measures of the spread thereof, as well as the socio-economic impacts of the economic and financial crisis. This will be done through sustained advocacy, prevention and protection risk mitigation and enhanced protection responses.

The project will provide critical protection assistance to Palestine refugees, including to those who are displaced and those returning to their habitual residence in Syria. This will be done through various interventions. Mainstreaming protection within UNRWA services will remain a priority. Corresponding to needs, protection trainings, including on disability inclusion, GBV, PSEA, addressing violence against children, will be delivered to a wide range of staff and volunteers, who will in turn use these skills in their day-to-day direct delivery of services to refugees. 

Additionally, through this project, UNRWA will continue to build the capacity of programmes to strengthen case management and referral processes for protection cases, including unaccompanied/separated Palestine refugee children, persons with disabilities (including those injured as a result of the conflict), older persons and those affected by violence, GBV, abuse and neglect. Dedicated programmatic responses will be implemented through regular service-delivery and stand-alone community-based and individually targeted initiatives to support the needs of vulnerable populations including to address psychosocial distress. It will also enhance the safety of children who have returned to a heavily bombarded refugee camp by clearing rubble around their school and creating a safe playground area. Areas most affected by the conflict as well as displaced and returning populations will be prioritized. 

Legal support services will be offered prioritising women and children experiencing GBV through assistance to obtain civil documentation and referrals to external partners. Mine risk awareness campaigns will be delivered throughout the country targeting students and other community members, with a specific focus on areas of spontaneous returns. 

This project will also support UNRWA&#x2019;s protection monitoring, reporting and advocacy efforts which will continue to be prioritised through the participation of UNRWA in global protection mechanisms and the international human rights system (IHRS), and through interaction with relevant stakeholders, including with the protection sector of the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Syria. In parallel, UNRWA will focus specifically on monitoring the return of Palestine refugees displaced within and outside Syria.

All of the above interventions will be carried out with full consideration of the relevant COVID-19 preventive measures including the safety protocols for the gradual re-opening of community centres.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing protection through community-based services to high priority areas in three governorates: Homs, Idlib, and Deir-ez-Zor</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary aim of this proposal is to respond to the severe and urgent protection concerns in Homs, Deir-ez-Zor and Idlib Governorates, through community-based protection interventions targeting the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs.

The protracted displacement crisis, degradation of services and continuous deterioration of living conditions exacerbated by the negative socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and the Syrian currency depreciation, has increasingly affected all population groups throughout the country. The needs have become vast and community resources are overstretched while the resilience capacity has been severely eroded, further undermining the ability of communities to recover from complex and multi-linked protection issues, potentially triggering additional negative coping mechanisms and increasing intra group tensions. 

Since late 2019, an increasingly high number of returns have been observed in Al-Qusair (Homs Governorate) and Sinjar (Idlib Governorate) while hostilities have abated in Deir-ez-Zor, making it possible to scale up much needed humanitarian interventions.

Providing community-based protection services will help meeting the critical gaps that have emerged in Al-Qusair (Homs), Sinjar (Idlib) , and in Deir-ez-Zor city (Deir-ez-Zor) as result of hostilities combined with the huge needs identified in the ground across sectors, and the limited humanitarian presence in these locations.

This project aims at re-establishing and strengthening community safety nets and networks in areas with high returnees and newly accessible areas, through empowering the community to take care of themselves.

Expansion of protection services and outreach activities is envisaged through the provision of protection services in community centers, via mobile units, and via a network of outreach volunteers and community-led initiatives (CLIs). 
Through community-based protection interventions, UNHCR and its partners will reinforce positive coping mechanisms, formulate practical solutions, and establish/maintain a solid protection referral system to support the timely, coordinated and principled delivery of assistance to the most vulnerable people.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">159 Damaged houses rehabilitation in Aleppo, Al Shaar</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 1st Standard Allocation intention is to &#x201C;address humanitarian needs in underserved areas, as based on the severity of needs and the current humanitarian response&#x201D;, coupled with the Shelter Sector Objective 2: Strengthen the resilience and cohesion of vulnerable communities by improving housing and related community or public infrastructure. Hence this project is designed to meet the dire need of returnees&#x2019; population in Jebel Samaan where the severity is 4 and [PiN is 636121.2], and (HNAP) July 2020 report 84,395 returnees. Rescate had finished 390 rehabilitation of damaged houses in 2019 in Al Shaar neighborhood. Noting that the area is eventually underserved in Aleppo per the outcome of the workshop in 2019 between the acting parties/sector and the governorate because it constitutes of ~5000 houses, yet interventions were limited to rehabilitation of Rescate 390 houses, ADRA 13 and DRC 16 [from Rescate]. 
The objective of the project is to rehabilitate damaged houses for vulnerable returnees 75% and people who stayed in their houses under the fighting 25%. Rescate will build its intervention on the remained houses from the previous project as Rescate is granted approval from MOLAE for the rehabilitation of 437 houses. Rescate finished only 390 houses due to lack of funding, the remaining 47 houses, Rescate transferred 16 to DRC available fund, while the remaining 31 are still awaiting without been rehabilitated and which BoQs and approvals are ready (attached). Under this Allocation, Rescate is submitting the proposal to rehabilitate the ready for implementation 31 houses, in addition to 128 (total 159) based on the added value of saving time, efforts, and costs since Rescate already has field assessment and detailed BOQs. The final approval procedures from MOLAE, require 6 weeks during which the first 31 will be ongoing. In coordination with the municipality, a desk will be set at the Mayor office to review beneficiaries&#x2019; HLP dox. Rescate will submit the intact files for MOLAE final approval.
Rescate will announce in newspapers amp Facebook call for contractors&#x2019; bids for the works. The contract award will be processed per Rescate procurement policy. Due to current unstable currency and market prices, Rescate will encourage contractors to submit proposals by giving the awarded contractors (two for risk mitigation) a down-payment of 30% on condition they immediately purchase the materials as per sample written approvals. Rescate team will inspect the materials at warehouses. 
The awarded contractors will start rehabilitation of the 1st Lots 20+11 from the ready approved houses. However, contractors will be asked to carry out the works with space segregation for Corona measures: All persons at site will be strictly using PPEs at all working-hours.
1) Works will be carried out in Lots of 20 each time
2) Each type of works will be carried out by a sub-contractor at each time, such as painting, sanitation, doors amp windows, wood, electrical works in one Lot at any one time, then 2nd Lot starts.
Rescate will finalize the procedure for the approvals of the 128 remaining apartments during the implementation of the first Lot 31 houses which is an added advantage for Rescate.
It is worth to state that Rescate engineering team are ready to start working with the gained experience from the 1st project in the same area of intervention. Rescate already obtained the structure safety licenses from the Syndicate for 65 green buildings under this intervention while the remaining 46 buildings license will be obtained accordingly. Rescate will work in the buildings where the common areas have already been concluded under the previous project, it is a positive impact on the cost. Rescate will reflect any savings from the fund by adding houses, with consideration to the vulnerability score  (FHHs, CHHs, elderly, families with PWDs) in addition to those who lost their jobs to COVID-19</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of essential winter Clothing packages to Children 0-14 years old in prioritized communities in Rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The widespread poverty combined with high commodity prices and destruction of housing stock continue to leave many Syrians unable to provide for the basic needs of the children including adequate clothing, especially during the wintertime when the families endure even higher costs of living. This is
particularly true for families who have been displaced several times and continue to live in dire
conditions, either still as internally displaced or as returnees. Rural Damascus is one of the most affected
governorates in Syria with high levels of infrastructure destruction, high population movement, and high
cost of living where the cost of WFP Reference Food Basket was SYP 87,522, one of the highest in the country. Indeed, prices of food in Rural Damascus has jumped by 300% between June 2019 and June 2020. 
Prices of food are not the only thing the IDP and returnees are facing, but many other things. According to UN field
monitoring, many returnees live in partially or fully destroyed homes, while rebuilding efforts are
hampered by the lack of resources and high prices. Given the high price of fuel and its scarcity, particularly after the Lebanese economic crisis started, many families are suffering accessing the energy products that are key to feed and warm their homes and children, and this will be more visible once the winter comes, and is coming with higher prices of NFIs, in particular clothes that receive around 20% of the average family expenditures on NFIs.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 crisis adds further pressure on countries that are already facing humanitarian crises. The impact of COVID-19 on children&#x2019;s living conditions are not distributed equally. As highlighted in the UN&#x2019;s policy brief on the impact of the ongoing crisis on children, the COVID-19 pandemic is a fundamentally dis-equalizing event, with its effects being expected to be most damaging for children in the poorest households. This project seeks to address the immediate and pressing need for winter clothes for around 25000
children 0-14 years old from the IDP, returnee and host communities in the prioritized areas of Rural Damascus governorate. The main objective of this project is to protect the most vulnerable children, especially
those affected by the crisis and displacement from harsh weather conditions through the provision of a
full package of winter clothes during the winter 2020-2021.
UNICEF aims to reach a total number of 25000 children (0-14) in the southern region during the
winter 2019-2020.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH life-saving assistance to vulnerable people residents and returnees in Jebel Saman Sub-District of Aleppo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Action aims at ensuring access to basic WASH-related needs for 37,703 vulnerable resident population and returnees living in the Sub-Districts of Jebel Saman, Aleppo Governorate.
The project intends to address the humanitarian needs in under-served areas, based on the severity of needs and the current humanitarian response, in addition to prepare for an enhanced response for medium-term COVID-19 interventions. Specifically, the project activities include: 
- Light rehabilitation of one water supply facilities, located in Zahraa communities (23,480 beneficiaries), focused on restoring pre-existing capacities in service delivery.
- Light rehabilitation of WASH facilities in 20 schools (14,224 beneficiaries). This includes hands-free hand-washing facilities, increasing of water storage, improvement of gender-oriented and inclusive sanitation facilities accessible to people with disability.
- Conduction of awareness campaign: (i) hygiene promotion campaign at community level in the area of the rehabilitated water supply system (23,480 beneficiaries), and (ii) conduction of risk communication and promotion of hand hygiene in 20 schools (14,224 beneficiaries), with the distribution of soaps and hygiene-cleaning kits for schools. This will establish hygienic behavior and practices to improve overall hygienic knowledge, attitude and practices, thus responding to COVID-19 preventive measures. 
The overall WASH condition of the selected area will improve, with positive consequences also in the nearby communities. The intervention targets also newly accessible areas from Damascus-based organizations, and therefore in high need of support. Beneficiaries will have their access to water improved through the rehabilitation of the water supply system, to sanitation through the rehabilitation of the WASH facilities in schools, and to hygiene and awareness through the risk communication campaign.

The action is fully aligned with the Allocation Objectives and priorities.
The activities have been identified through a need-based field assessment jointly conducted by GVC staff and line ministries&#x2019; personnel (Aleppo Water Board and DoE). The aim of the intervention, in line with 2020 HRP Objective 1, is to provide lifesaving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs. Eventually, the intervention is also aligned with the UNCT Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, and the Consolidated Planning and Requirements for COVID-19 Across Syria, contributing to prevent and mitigate the diffusion of the virus.
Selected locations are scored 3 in the WASH severity scale 2019, and are identified as priority by the WASH Sector. The activities will be fully coordinated with the WASH, Education Sectors, and line ministries.

The activities are developed in line with the international guidelines and standard (e.g. SPHERE Standard, IASC Guidelines, INEE minimum standards, etc.). 

The intervention will be fully and directly implemented by GVC staff, which is actively present in the identified area since 2014. Operations will be coordinated from GVC office in Aleppo.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthen life-saving WASH basic services in underserved return areas to mitigate the risk of disease outbreak and restore community resilience</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The provision of WASH basic services is critical for all vulnerable people affected by the conflict and vital in some underserved remote rural areas affected by the conflict where humanitarian needs are underestimated. The hereby project will provide WASH assistance to highly vulnerable communities in the governorates of Daraa and Rural Damascus (Eastern Ghouta) according to the needs assessment conducted by TGH in June and July 2020. 

The rehabilitation of water systems will provide 17,000 individuals with access to water in Qasemiyeh and Beit Sawa (Rural Damascus). The rehabilitation of sanitation network will provide 2,000 individuals with an improved sanitary environment in Izra&apos; (Daraa). 

This project will target remote rural areas in Eastern Ghouta (EG) which suffered high levels of destruction, including water infrastructure used as a weapon during the crisis. In Dara&#x2019; Governorate, Izra&#x2019; city has been severely affected by the conflict due to destruction and significant influx of IDPs. Therefore, these urban areas will also be targeted to improve the living conditions of IDPs and host community and reduce the risk of disease outbreak in this densely populated city. 

The targeted areas have long been underserved by humanitarian actors, due to limited access because of tense security situation or remoteness. In all areas, the most common (if not the sole) source of water for drinking, cooking and hygiene purposes is trucked water, mostly ensured by humanitarian agencies in EG, while organized and paid by communities themselves in other areas. As a response, this project includes life-saving activities aiming at addressing immediate water needs while contributing to building resilience and exit strategy &#x2013; i.e. rehabilitation and/or upgrade of boreholes and rehabilitation of water networks. 

Since the 22nd of March, Syria is hurt by the COVID-19 outbreak and even though the spread of the virus seems controlled, the number of cases keeps on increasing since the beginning of June. TGH proposed intervention integrates a mainstream COVID-19 response to mitigate the spread of the virus during the implementation of humanitarian activities. More generally, the project aims at limiting the risk of disease outbreak. Hence, the project includes a life-sustaining response aiming at improving the sanitation environment through the rehabilitation of sewage network. Other TGH grants such as ECHO and SHF COVID-19 project complement the activities proposed in the frame of this allocation with distribution of hygiene kits and soaps and the implementation of hygiene promotion sessions in the same localities, and are then, not integrated as such, in the hereby project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Response in Aleppo, Hama and Deir-ez-Zor</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 12- month project has two parts: the first is in As-Safira and Banan sub-districts of Aleppo, and Suran district in Hama to meet life-saving WASH needs of 172,824 persons. The second is to restore WASH facilities in 4 schools in Ashara, Deir-ez-Zor. The project has 3 outcomes:
1) Vulnerable communities have access to sustainably managed and improved water and sanitation services.
2) Mothers and carers are able to practice and influence hygiene behaviour change through hygiene awareness and access to hygiene items, and adolescent girls are better informed and able to manage menstruation. 
3) Meet the WASH facility needs of children in schools. Besides SHF, complementary / supportive activities under this outcome will also be co-funded by FCDO ($390k for hygiene promotion in schools and communities) and ECHO ($400k for rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure). 
All the outcomes contribute to addressing humanitarian needs in underserved areas as outlined in the allocation paper, and also preventive measures required for COVID-19 as per Response Plan.
Outcome 1 will reach 20,743 people with improved access to water as a result of repair and rehabilitation of 2 water systems. Frontline technical staff from the local water establishment and sewerage and sanitation department will also be assessed and trained to meet gaps in their capacity to operate and maintain the water and sanitation system. This will benefit a population of 70,050 people with a sustainably managed water supply.
Outcome 2 will reach 17,500 people by hygiene promotion activities and campaigns employing Mum&#x2019;s Magic Hands (MMH), a versatile evidenced-based behaviour change approach that employs using emotional motivators through storytelling, positively reinforcing good behaviours and activities. MMH is based on formative research conducted by Oxfam amp Unilever to better understand motivators and barriers among mothers affected by emergency and has been used in several countries. 
In As-Safira Aleppo, we will use MMH approach to improve the identified priority risky hygiene behaviours related to poor personal and environmental hygiene conditions, including menstrual hygiene, handwashing and adapting COVID-19 safe measures. This will involve mobilising 25 MMH Community-based volunteers, who will be trained to facilitate basic hygiene awareness and water related disease prevention to 2,500 mothers and carers of 1,250 children including those with disabilities. They will also track and report on the communities&#x2019; perceptions about C19 to bring in evidence of more effective measures. 1,750 men, women and disabled persons will be selected according to a community criterion and receive essential family hygiene kits in the community and 1,150 girls will receive female hygiene kits appropriate to their age. 
Outcome 3: To support this project, a separately funded outcome will ensure within the locations, 10 Schools are assessed in consultation with the Directorate of Education, whereby an output will include 4 schools and their catchments population more focused to school children will gain access to gender and disability friendly WASH facilities and services. All children will attend conservation awareness that is attributed to water and environmental sanitation, and hygiene awareness related to COVID19 and water related disease prevention measures.

Oxfam is already implementing a multisectoral programme in neighbouring areas in the southern rural Aleppo covering WASH and food security needs and has good access to the targeted locations and communities.
In Deir-ez-Zor, this project will complement existing work funded by ECHO and FCDO in Ashara, providing the final piece of the puzzle for 4 schools and their catchments to have access to appropriate WASH facilities, hygiene materials and hygiene promotion. Restored infrastructure, to which schools will be connected through this project, will also benefit households in surrounding communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian response to improve access to basic WASH services for vulnerable and conflict-affected populations in Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Close to nine years into the crisis, the scale, severity, and complexity of needs across Syria remain staggering. In addition, COVID-19 is exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. At least 5 million people are in critical need of improved water quality and quantity and 4.7 million people face sanitation related issues.  
Protracted and new displacements and people returning to their place of origin put further pressure on the overburdened education system. As a result, one in three schools are partially damaged or destroyed. This has led to a reduction in access to education facilities and overcrowded classrooms. 

AAH has been assessing villages in Aleppo and Idleb governorates showing how the water and sanitation systems have been affected, including WASH facilities in schools, as a consequence of the destruction, whereas the dependency on water trucking and the use of contaminated shallow water has increased. Urgent needs have been identified and significant gaps exist due to lack of repairs and/or minimal and poor maintenance of water and sanitation systems. 

Taking into consideration the 2020 1st Standard Allocation strategy, the 2020 HRP WASH objectives and the needs identified in the field, AAH will focus on the repair and rehabilitation of public water and sewerage systems for water supply and proper sanitation, as well as undertake light rehabilitation of WASH facilities in primary and secondary schools. 

The proposed intervention targets a total of 26,818 individuals (49% females 70% children) in the following locations: 
(1) Aleppo governorate, Menbij district, Maskana sub-district: 12,200 individuals (returnees) will receive Community WASH component and 9,060 individuals (returnees, IDPs) WASH in School activities. AAH will rehabilitate 56 primary and/or secondary schools benefitting 8,676 children and 384 teachers. 
(2) Aleppo governorate, Menbij district, Al-Khafsa sub-district: 4,823 individuals (returnees and IDPs) will benefit from WASH in School activities. AAH will rehabilitate 23 primary and/or secondary schools benefitting 4,650 children and 173 teachers.
(3) Idleb governorate, Abul Thohur: 735 individuals (returnees and IDPs) will benefit from WASH in School activities. AAH will rehabilitate 7 primary and/or secondary schools benefitting 693 children and 42 teachers.

These interventions will contribute to WASH cluster strategic objectives (1) Support to water, sanitation/sewage and solid waste management systems to ensure regular services for affected people in Syria and (3) Improve WASH facilities and services in institutions to minimize substandard WASH conditions of the most vulnerable people in Syria. 

The WASH in schools component comprising of following activities, repair and rehabilitation of WASH facilities in 86 schools, is estimated to cost USD 400,000 and covered by SHF, whereas the community WASH component, comprising of the following activities, repair and rehabilitation of water and sewage systems, and covered by SHF, is estimated to cost USD 630,000. The project will reach 26,818 beneficiaries (14,618 in Schools, 12,200 in community)

Overall, the proposed project mainstreams and incorporates protection principles in the activities to promote meaningful access, safety and dignity. Despite the challenging environment, and thanks to its effective access strategy, AAH has full-access to the targeted areas and has the capacity in place to start the operations according to the work-plan set through direct-implementation.

Particular attention has been paid to ensure activities implemented by AAH are not a duplication of activities undertaken by other agencies in the area and complement activities from other actors.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this proposed project, SIF will participate in improving the WASH infrastructure in some of the highest severity communities in, Rural Damascus (Kafarbatna, Kisweh) and Daraa (Sheikh Miskeen) which in turn will participate in taking the needed measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19 by providing clean water for drinking and domestic use. Moreover, SIF plans to provide waste bins to allow better disposal of garbage and reduce the amount of infection caused by the existence of garbage in streets. SIF WASH team conducted an in-depth technical assessment in July 2020 which showed that WASH infrastructure - such as water and sewage pipes - was severely damaged, resulting in the mixing and dumping of wastewater. in water source or flooding the streets, thus contaminating the soil and the overall management of water resources. According to 2020 HNO, 23% of waste is disposed of inappropriately in communities and at least 80% of wastewater is discharged without treatment, while at least half of sewage systems are not functional across the country. SIF decided to implement the project through the following activities that will be implemented in accordance with the guidelines of the WASH Sector to ensure a successful sustainable intervention

-	Borehole Rehabilitation (Rural Damascus).
-	Sewage system rehabilitation (Rural Damascus).
-	Solid waste bins distribution and debris removal and garbage disposal (Rural Damascus and Daraa).

The intervention will mainly consist in replacing sewage pipes, excavating manholes, supplying and installing submersible pumps, in addition to installing generators for the boreholes.
The sewage system rehabilitation will benefit 23,000 individuals in Rural Damascus and 3825 in Hama. As for the boreholes rehabilitation, it will benefit 60,000 individuals in Rural Damascus. Whereas the debris removal will benefit 20,000 in Rural Damascus. Moreover, the distribution of waste bins will benefit 60,000 individuals in Rural Damascus and 35,000 in Daraa.
The above-mentioned &#xFB01;gures are based on preliminary estimations and could change during the implementation.

SIF will rely on a contractor to rehabilitate sewage networks, boreholes and drinking water networks. Contractor selection will be based on SIF Standards of Procedures (SoPs) in order to ensure transparency and accountability of the selection process. Composed of skilled and experienced engineers, SIF WASH technical team will supervise contractor teams on daily basis in order to ensure the quality delivery of planned works. Contractors will also be asked to provide a period of guarantee in order to ensure the sustainability of the works. Furthermore, to provide a livelihood opportunity for people from the targeted communities, SIF will ask the contractors through a contractual obligation to include qualified workers in implementing the works in order for them to generate income and support their families.  

Coordination with administrative and community-based local entities has been considered as a priority by SIF to ensure the sustainability of the action. As part of the design of the proposed project, Executive Office of the governorate, Ministry of Local Affair, SARC and representatives from the local community were consulted by SIF in order to assess the needs, design the project implementation and avoid any overlapping with planned rehabilitation projects at community level.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support mitigation measures in Syrian cities in responding to COVID-19 pandemic</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Entering its 10th consecutive year of violent conflict, several factors make Syria highly vulnerable to a severe outbreak of COVID-19, these include: a vastly damaged infrastructure and a large internally displaced population living in high-density residential areas with an inability to isolate or practicing physical distancing.  

During the year 2020, UN-Habitat adopted a comprehensive plan to support Syrian cities to handle with COVID-19 pandemic by empowering municipalities and local bodies as front-lines to effectively respond to such crises through providing support in improving public hygiene and sanitation services and other WASH activities related to COVID-19. 
Currently, UN-HABITAT is implementing several COVID projects from different donors in several Syrian cities, including Homs, Hama, Daraa, Suran, Harasta, Douma, Al-Tal, Jaramana, and others.

Therefore, by integrating with above mentioned projects, UN-Habitat Syria proposes herein a multi-locations intervention that contributes to reinforce the preparedness and responsiveness of target communities to COVID-19 disease outbreak, by supporting the improvement of environmental conditions and the decontamination measures to reduce the spread of the pandemic.

The cities of Arbin (in Rural Damascus) and Suran (in North Rural of Hama) have received high number of returnees which further strains the capacity of the already damaged sanitation and hygiene systems. Both cities are suffering from the urgent need to support sewage networks and hygiene conditions to cope with increasing number of residents especially in the context of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.

The project includes several components, in two highly severe cities, that fall under the environmental solid waste and WASH sector including:

1. Rehabilitation of the wastewater network in Arbin city to avoid the flooding in the most of buildings&apos; basements, and to prevent the leakage from wastewater into the water resources. As per WHO and UNICEF guidelines,COVID-19 persist in drinking-water, feces and sewage.
2. Supply and provision of sterilization solutions, portable spraying devices, PPEs and cleaning tools for municipal solid waste workers in Arbin city.
3. Rehabilitation of wastewater network in Suran city.
4. Supply and provision of solid waste containers, sterilization solutions, portable spraying devices, PPEs and cleaning tools for municipal solid waste workers in Suran city.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide Food Support and increase resiliency of vulnerable communities and Households including PLWs and PWDs in Rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project aims to improve the food security and livelihood status of most vulnerable people through life-sustaining food assistance (linked to 2nd and 3rd HRP 2020 ) with special focus on PLWs with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) , Caregivers of children with SAM and/or MAM , female-headed households, people with disabilities, elderly people, and daily workers who lost their jobs during COVID-19 outbreak through the distribution of food vouchers/ Commodity Vouchers targeted 1286 households (6,432 individuals, 824 Men - 1325 Woman - 2141 Boys and 2142 Girls). in high severity scales locations in Rural Damascus(Madaya and AL-Zabadani  ), the amount of each voucher will be 100,000 SYP according to WFP Minimum Expenditure Basket for 4 Cycles/Months.

In purpose of providing supplementary food assistance to Persons with Specific Needs (PSN) through appropriate modalities and based on the conducted assessment in the targeted locations, TdH will distribute specialized Food voucher (nutrition voucher) for PLWs with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) in order to meet their basic nutrition needs.
A suitably composed food voucher is critical to maintaining the nutritional status of affected people, especially when they are fully dependent on food aid.
The size and composition of the food voucher is tailored to local preferences, demographic profile, activity levels, climatic conditions, local coping capacity and existing levels of malnutrition and disease. It is designed to meet the nutritional requirements of a population rather than individuals (who can be targeted through tailored nutrition programs).
When people are fully dependent on food assistance, the standard is to provide 2,100 calories per person, 10-12 percent of which come from protein and 17 percent from fat (according to WHO/FAO guidelines), and micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron, iodine and zinc.
When the people we serve are not dependent on us for all of their food needs, the program only aims to &#x201C;top up&#x201D; food that is available, based on an understanding of current access to food. A supplementary ration is mostly given to a vulnerable group such as small children or PLWs to prevent or treat malnutrition.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will include equipping and operating three geographically distributed medical centers in Deir Ezzor Governorate
Three areas were carefully selected in Deir Ezzor Governorate in coordination with the Health Directorate in Deir Ezzor Governorate and Dr. Haitham Al-Shaher, the health sector official in Deir Al-Zour.
These areas are: (Harabash, Al-Shamtiya, and Al-Sabkhan) located in the south, east and west of Deir Ezzor, and it is one of the most densely populated areas and the most in need, according to the association&apos;s management evaluation team report.
Each medical center will be provided with the following services:
1. Primary health services through three clinics. Internal medicine, gynecology and children.
2. Childcare clinic, which provides health services, including follow-up of child malnutrition cases. It will also provide preventive and curative nutritional supplements for children, with a referral service for acute malnutrition cases to hospitals.
3. Free medicines by referrals from the doctors of the same medical centers.
4- Referrals for surgical procedures (general, neurological, urinary, orthopedic, cardiac, normal deliveries, caesarean section, incubators, and severe malnutrition in children)
5. Provide audio, visual and kinetic secondary medical aids with a referral system.
6. Provide individual mental health care sessions with measures to prevent COVID-19, and will be made available specifically for individuals in post-war trauma.
Each medical center will provide primary and secondary health care services free of charge to the residents of those areas as most of the residents of these areas are internally displaced persons, hosts or returnees.
The headquarters of the centers are the private property of individuals from the local community who provided them free of charge to the association to provide these medical services free of charge in cooperation with a large number of notables in the regions.
Since the association has a branch in Deir Ezzor and has an agreement with the Ministry of Health in the Syrian government to provide care services for cancer patients, the association has the capabilities to implement the project according to the specified date and to obtain administrative approvals very quickly (the association is one of the associations specialized in providing medical services and has full management facilities To obtain the necessary approvals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of NFIs to the most vulnerable families in Deir-Ez-Zor City</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Action aims at increasing access to core relief and Covid-19/Hygiene items for the most vulnerable families living in Deir Ez Zor (DEZ) city. The proposal is in line with the Fund&#x2019;s Strategic Objective 1 (Provide lifesaving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs), Sector&#x2019;s Specific Objectives and SRP Strategic Objectives responding to life-sustaining needs in high severity areas. DEZ city is ranked 3 in the NFI Sector&#x2019;s severity scale. The proposal addressed critical gaps and meets the needs of vulnerable groups.
The humanitarian consequences for people suffering from the crisis in Syria are wide-ranging and profound. Recent economic shocks further set back the recovery of the Syrian people. The crisis has also impacted Syrian&#x2019;s purchasing power: Syrians are buying fewer goods and selecting goods of lower quality.  At the same time, COVID-19 is having consequences on people&#x2019;s livelihoods with many losing income and failing to access resources needed for basic needs.
The intervention is designed on GVC needs assessment (NA) conducted on families of out-of-school or at risk of dropping out for reasons related to poor economic condition of their families targeted by GVC Non-formal education programs. The analysis revealed that the majority of HHs do not have the ability to afford the basic non-food and hygiene items (see GVC needs assessment of NFI in Deir-Ez-Zor City).
To respond to the latter, and to integrate the action with education and protection programs delivered by GVC, the project targets the most vulnerable HHs among GVC&#x2019;s beneficiaries&#x2019; database. 
Based on the NA outcomes on a sample of 1,000 HHs (7,523 individuals) the action will benefit 1,320 HHs, thus an estimated total of 9,923 individuals (estimation of 7.5 individuals/HH) , around 32% of the almost 31,000 PIN living in DEZ Sub-District. The project includes the distribution of Covid-19/hygiene items and core relief items. Distribution will take place in pre-identified schools on weekends. Schools as distribution points can be better monitored with respect to Covid-19 precautionary measures. Therefore, no more than 82 persons per distribution will be reached. During and after the distributions, GVC will conduct DDM and PDM, elaborated by MEAL Department. For the PDM, GVC will reach beneficiaries by phone, receive their feedback on the provided items in order to assess if the humanitarian assistance was delivered in a safe, accessible and participatory manner. COVID-19 precautionary measures will be adopted in line with Sectors&#x2019; standards, stated in Recommendations for adjusting NFI amp Emergency Shelter Distributions in the context of Covid-19 outbreak. 
The expected impact of the intervention is to mitigate the economic barriers of vulnerable HHs in DEZ city, and to improve their life conditions and resilience especially in the context of the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention will discourage negative coping mechanisms such as inadequate hygiene measures in relation to COVID-19, child labour and early marriage, as well as enhance children return/retention to education.
Since 2017, GVC provides humanitarian assistance to DEZ population through Education and WASH projects funded by OCHA, UNICEF, ECHO and the Italian Cooperation. The project is part of GVC holistic strategy to support people affected by the conflict. Owing to GVC&#x2019;s long-lasting presence the intervention will be implemented by staff with strong relations with the local authorities and humanitarian actors, and complete accessibility.
GVC will coordinate with SARC, MoE, NFI and WASH Sectors as well as other present humanitarian actors (UNICEF and UNHCR) to ensure information sharing, and avoid duplication and overlapping. GVC considers the possibility to scale-up the present proposal and carry out distributions of winterization items based on identified needs of HHs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Undertake light rehabilitation of sanitation facilities for affected people in Deir Ez Zour city in Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On the 11th year of conflict, the scale amp diversity of WASH needs, overall people in need of WASH assistance are 10.7 m, which is complemented by figures presenting specific WASH needs for sanitation (4.7 m), amp heavy financial burden linked with purchasing water amp/or hygiene supplies (7.9 m). (WASH HNO 2020).
The main objective of this intervention is support sanitation management systems to ensure regular services for affected people in Al Omal district who need network rehabilitation to ensure safe disposal amp waste management. The main line size is 2&#x201D; which is not sufficient to the needs of the increased returnees&#x2019; population. Lines of 2,210 ML were probed, scanned, or examined results 1330 ML was identified for replacement (880 polyethylene + 450 PVC pipes). Rehabilitation of undamaged pipes using Sewage suction truck equipped with tanks, sewer jet vacuum amp high-pressure water jet equipment to open the blockage of waste water pipelines to be operational after connection with the newly replaced pipes to ensure optimal performance. Cleaning the tunnels amp re-cover the pipes per the approved technical standards. This will save local community amp 430 HHs returnees while the sanitation was not functioning from serious health risks.
In DEZ, access to safe sanitation system is compromised based on the fact of lack of maintenance amp rehabilitation of the networks which are not functioning due to un-addressed damages, consequently increasing the likelihood of waterborne diseases spreading due to poor sanitation amp limited ability to practice good hygiene. The project impact with improved sanitation infrastructure amp will support Covid-19 response as locality hygiene is a main requirement to ensure pandemic amp contagion control. As Rescate amp Syria Trust worked together in DEZ since 2018 in assessments seeking to implement projects such as damaged houses rehabilitation. Our goal is to provide integrated response to help in building resilience amp creating sense of stability for the returnees amp population in the city. Rescate will deliver the services of pipelines rehabilitation through reinforcement of available service providers related to WASH sector. A candid review of the rapid technical assessment to ensure detailed BOQ inclusion in the tender call for the works. Rescate intervention in response to 4 severity score city (SYRIA 2021 HNO). This project will enhance beneficiaries&#x2019; resilience by enabling them to direct their resources to more tangible needs amp to safeguard their health amp hygiene under the current deteriorated health pandemic especially Covid-19. Rescate will enter agreement with experienced local contractors to provide works under close supervision of Rescate experience team. A claim mechanism will be introduced MampE officer will monitor implementation amp prepare reports about progress, maintain track of works vs budget amp action plan, amp about beneficiaries&#x2019; segregation (gender, age amp PWDs) amp social impact. A questionnaire to assess beneficiaries&#x2019; satisfaction during amp after the project implementation. Rescate maintains a schedule for financial amp narrative, share info via WASH Sector.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pilot Shelter Solutions for the most vulnerable newly displaced groups.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation across northwest Syria, particularly in Idleb and Aleppo governorates continues to deteriorate at an alarming rate due to ongoing violence and this project aims to provide key and complementary services to cover the immediate shelter needs of the most vulnerable newly displaced groups, supporting their resilience with a better-dignified shelter solution and piloting new shelter concept to enhance the living standards of the camps inhabitants and to reflect better practice on the usage and the duration of the Refugee Housing Units.

One basic target is to ensure that IDP households will benefit from this shelter with three years of free accommodation as it is the minimum age of the provided RHUs considering its flexibility and ability to be assembled/disassembled to reallocate to another location.

It is also to respond to the Shelter/NFI sector objectives to &#x201C;Provide life-saving and life-sustaining shelter and NFI support / Reinforce an enabling protection environment and community cohesion by improving housing and related community/public infrastructure&#x201D;.

The shelter is the most urgent need, as millions of people have been pushed into small areas not equipped to support that many people, especially during the cold winter. While the direct exposure to hostilities continues to pervade the protection environment in northwest Syria, the escalation of hostilities has taken a toll on the provision of Shelter and health support for the affected IDPs and host communities.

The main outputs of this project are:
1- Provide 500 Refugee Housing Units for 500 Households (3,000 individuals) to support hosting the newly displaced households who do not have a safe and secure shelter.

2- Improve the camp management quality in and accountability of IDP sites by training camp inhabitants to establish services committees and maintain the daily needs in IDP sites including First Aid Training, Protection mainstreaming, Safe uses of water, hygiene promotion activities, fire-fighting training, and governance outreach.

3- Provide complementary aid including:
- Distribution of 500 NFI kits for the camp arrivals.
- Monthly distribution of Food Rations to cover the food needs of the camp inhabitants.
- Provide safe water trucking services for five months for all the targeted beneficiaries.
- Provide solid waste management and desludging activities to support better sanitation and to avoid water-borne diseases.
- Provide protection services and ensure better GBV risk outreach and understanding of the purpose of the protection provided activities.

4- Coordination with other active partners and clusters to cover the education, health and livelihood services as well as sharing all the related information with key related clusters and stakeholders.

After coordinating with local actors, WATAN Foundation has managed to secure three public lands (2 in Aleppo - 1 in Idleb) to be targeted with this project.
After conducting the HLP checklist, get the approvals, and taking into consideration the security situation and the availability of the nearby services and water wells, the best choice was Akhterin - Aleppo.
The area is 150,000 square meters of public land (36&#xB0;29&apos;19.04&quot;N -  37&#xB0;23&apos;37.05&quot;E) and it is considered safe and it is located at a far distance from the front lines.
WATAN Team can relocate the same project and the project activities in any other public land with clear HLP due diligence and documents.

Taking into consideration the Shelter/NFI and CCCM Clusters&apos; priorities, WATAN Foundation can provide normal tents instead of RHUs if the implementation of the pilot shelter is not considered to be
appropriate in the current response.

As the on-going Coronavirus continues to develop where camps and gathering places consider more vulnerable to host, this project will follow WHO recommendations strictly supporting the emergency preparedness and response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response life-saving food for the newly IDPs by providing ready to eat rations (RTERs) and food rations.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to emergency life-saving assistance to recently displaced populations by providing RTERs, and food rations by e-voucher modality to the newly vulnerable IDP families which displaced within the last 2 months due to the continuous dispute and conflict in NW Syria.
GAN will intervene through 2 activities:
1-Providing RTERs to 957 families(5533 individuals) of newly IDPs in Maaret Tamasrin 4 times each time enough for 5 persons for 5 days, this intervention is considered as a rapid response for affected IDPs those suffering from lack of resources, instability and don&#x2019;t have cooking facilities (this period of this type of assistance is recommended by FSL cluster).
GAN will distribute RTEs for each family two times each time the beneficiary will be delivered double quantity of RTE to decrease contacting between the beneficiaries and the teams from 4 to 2 times as a mitigation measure related to COVID-19
2-Providing food rations by e-voucher modality with the aim of saving lives and ensuring continued and regular access to food for 3 months, the proposed activity is designed according to the family size (13$ per person monthly)as follows:
1-2 people in a family: 26$
3 people:39$
4 people:52$
5 people:65$
6 people:78$ etc
GAN will target 1061 family (6104individuals) in Salqin and 500 families (2900 individuals) in Kafar Takharim of newly IDPs according to the following prioritization criteria:
- Families with: children below six (6) years old - elderly members - disabled members - severely ill members.
- Women and children headed HHs.
- Families who didn&apos;t receive humanitarian assistance in the new site.
Some vulnerable groups will have special consideration when delivering assistance like girls and women, elderly and people with disabilities, GAN will deliver these groups to their homes, it is expected that 5% of the targeted families will meet these criteria.
Each family head will receive the assistance package(includes the assistance terms, list of vendors, list of items, instructions, and voucher NFC card) and orientation session during the first preparatory month.
The family head will be able to use the e-voucher card immediately after the orientation sessions at the beginning of the second month. Starting from the second month, the beneficiary will be able to buy his/her needs among 40 specified items with restricted amounts that are allowed in the e-voucher card to fulfill the calorie standard set by the WFP.
Compared to other alternatives of disbursing cash, including paper vouchers, GAN chose to implement through e-voucher system based on many reasons, such as saving the dignity of beneficiaries and creates a safe space for IDPs to be engaged with the host communities, as to prevent of food basket selling which is frequently happened. The e-voucher system increases the variety of food items which has a good health and nutrition impact on beneficiaries for example they will be able to buy fresh meat, chicken, eggs and vegetables beside what they need of groceries especially during the month of Ramadan, as the month of Ramadan will be among the redemption vouchers process period.
GAN implemented similar project in 2019 in Afrin city under 2018 4th RA and the result of TPM was 100% of the surveyed beneficiaries felt comfortable to use the e-voucher system instead of other modalities.
MampE plan will be conducted during the project with PDM and a clear complaint mechanism for beneficiaries against vendors and employees.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Functionality of 3 Community- Based Isolation Centers in North-West Syria by Human Appeal International Under the Health Cluster/ Gaziantep Hub COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a contribution by Human Appeal International (Hereinafter referred to as HAI) to the COVID-19 preparedness and response plan for North-west Syria, and in coordination with the COVID-19 taskforce of the health cluster Gaziantep hub, HAI seeks to support the operational costs of three community based isolation centers CBICs in three different locations within Harim and Jisr-Ash-Shugur districts/ North-West Idleb.
The project duration is 7 months and 1 day. However, the first 2 months and 1 day of which is for preparations required for the project including the procurement of the PPE, IPC items and essential medicines as well the provision of other medical and non-medical supplies needed. Also, the preparation phase is expected to serve as appropriate duration for Qatar Charity (The partner responsible for the establishment of the centers and handing them to Human Appeal) to undertake its part of the overall intervention. after the preparation phase of the project ends, Human Appeal plans to start providing the isolation and supportive therapy services for the beneficiaries in need at the proposed three CBICs.

The proposed CBICs are planned to provide the suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 with isolation measures and supportive therapy needed to improve their conditions and to decrease the transmission of the infection within the targeted communities. HA will ensure that the proposed three CBICs are staffed and equipped according to the guidelines communicated by the task-force, and proposes to support their functionality for a period of 5 months. The proposed CBICs will act as stations to manage the suspected/ confirmed cases of COVID-19 with mild symptoms through providing the required isolation and supportive therapy services, which will potentially contribute to the overall response plan and reduce the level of pressure applied to the hospital as being the stations of more advanced case management measures. During the first month of the project, HAI will ensure that all the preparations needed for the service provision are fulfilled including the procurement and provision of the medical and non-medical supplies, recruiting the needed human resources and establishing the required coordination channels with the other partners and coordination bodies connected to the response plan.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide life-saving and life-sustaining coordinated, equitable health services for all age and sex groups boys, girls, women, and men, with attention to people with special needs without any sexual discrimination, among IDPs and host communities in 14 sub-districts in Idleb and Aleppo governorates-Syria through establishing (installation) of Community-Based Isolation Centers (CBICs) that provides sample collection and observation of suspected COVID-19 cases, accommodation and follow up of the confirmed mild cases and short monitoring and surveillance of the recovered cases till they are discharged. Estimated direct beneficiaries: 2,800 while total population in the catchment area of CBICs  is 673,246
This project reflects the high coordination with other Health NGOs in COVID-19 Task force which is the umbrella for other complimentary activities (such as training of health staff, triage, lab testing and surveillance, referral and checkpoints managing) to compose a coherent system that efficiently contains COVID-19 outbreak in case it comes up. CBIC is composed of 6 rub hall tents+ 12 smaller ordinary tents each rub hall is divided into patient wards for different purposes to serve a pre-designed patient flow to guarantee the isolation of the suspected and confirmed mild cases and to provide them with the supportive therapy till they recover and discharged. This flow design was created in the COVID-19 Task force under technical advisory of the World Health Organization (WHO) to serve as a buffer system designed to protect vulnerable communities in Syria from COVID-19 spread, especially residents of overcrowded areas, specifically camps, where the patient does not have the possibility of home isolation in case he/she is became a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.
Patient flow in CBIC will be as follows:
Stage 1: accommodates 10 patients, which is the registration and survey point that records the suspected patients before they enter to move to the control area (stage 2). Suspected patients will be transferred from different health facilities (after screening) via the referral system. The suspected COVID-19 patient will be decontaminated, the sample will be withdrawn and sent to the laboratory. The patient will remain in the observation area pending the results of the laboratory. Hygiene measures will be taken (hand washing, wearing suit and face mask). If the laboratory results are negative, the patient will be discharged after decontamination. If the results of the laboratory are positive, then the patient will be transferred to the case management area where will remain until recovery.
Stage 2: accommodates 20 patients, which is the space for managing and isolating minor cases: supportive treatment will be applied. If the patient deteriorates, he will be transferred to the specified referral isolation hospitals. The average period for a patient to stay in this department is 14 days, until he has fully recovered.
Stage 3: accommodates 20 patients, after the patient improves, s/he will be transferred to the healing area where s/he will be re-tested/ if it is negative, will be discharged after decontamination.

A scheme of the Community-Based Isolation Unit is attached.

The main activities of the project are: 
 Carry out the planned procurement process for materials needed to establish CBICs.
 Coordination with stakeholders at the sites in need that were previously identified for setting up units.
 Install and setup units.
 Handing over the units to partner concerned with operating the units in coordination with the COVID-19 Task force and health directorates.
 Paper and media documentation.
 Close the project with the final report.

From the perspective of gender-based violence, QC will ensure that the standards of gender-based violence are integrated into the design of CBICs where there will be women&apos;s areas (for patients and personnel) separate from men&apos;s areas in line with th</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SAMS through the project period of 4 months will work on the response to the immediate life-saving health needs in NWS (Idleb and Aleppo governorates). The project is supporting the NWS HC COVID-19 PRP through supporting the three identified Hospital-Based Isolation Centers (HBICs).

Through supporting the three facilities with the procurement of PPE and IPC items, equipment and supplies, SAMS is willing to support the health cluster response to the potential COVID-19 outbreak in NWS through ensuring that the three facilities have the capacity to receive the suspected/confirmed cases and that severe and critical cases have access to the treatment. The targeted three hospitals with intensive care units in Idleb (Alzirra), Salqin and Daret Azza (Alamal) were identified by the COVID-19 taskforce as hospital based isolation centers (HBICs) for highly suspected/ confirmed. COVID-19 infection patient with severe symptoms and with underlying chronic condition (lung, heart, renal failure or immunocompromising condition. Thus, the Center will consist of three sections which includes ICU department, inpatient department and recovery department.. Each  hospital will have 30 ICU beds, 30 inpatients beds and 10 recovery beds with all required equipment.

The three HBICs will receive support from other donors where the operational costs are to be provided by OFDA supported SPACE consortium, while some urgent equipment will be provided as GIK through WHO. Moreover, while the TRC had procured the first batch of 35 ventilators with SCHF fund, 12 of them had been delivered to Al Zira&#x2019;a Hospital (10 of them were allocated to Salqin and Al Amal), and with the second procurement process of 45 ventilators (with the TF allocating 40 of them at least to Salqin and Al Amal hospitals) taking place, the remaining gap of 28 ventilators will be secured to the 3 facilities through SCHF funding through the TRC.

SAMS has submitted the proposal after long discussions with the WHO and the humanitarian leadership that the SCHF is the only available source of fund we have to procure PPEs and medical equipment.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on NWS&apos;s novel coronavirus strategic preparedness and response plan the sub- task taskforce technical group assumed high caseload of infected patient due the current overcrowded living condition and protentional inefficient housing space for self-isolation in the camps and host communities, propose to establish community based Isolation, which will offer   separate space for the suspected/ confirm COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic condition (lung, heart, renal failure or immunocompromising condition). Furthermore, the Community based Isolation will reduce the burden of caseload at hospital isolation, which strictly will handle severe cases.
Through this project we&apos;ll operate 2 community based isolation centers (CBICs) for 5 months, 1 will be in Harim and the other one in Sarmada (the 2 centers are in Idleb), the 2 centers will be equipped and provided with tents by Qatar Charity (QC), 
The 2 community- based Isolation Centres will run by trained health personnel community health worker and IPC worker and other supportive staff to basic health care services, each Isolation Centre will be with capacity of 50 beds (100 for the 2 CBICs) distributed in the following sections: 
1.	Screening area will be the entry point, in which under strict IPC precaution measures provided by 21 IPC workers in each center (7 per 8-hours shift per day), the patient will be checked based on the patient screen questionnaires. Patient not fit the case definition will be allowed to enter the health facility, while the suspected cases matching the case definition will be referred to observation areas for further medical assessment by trained physician.
2.	Observation areas with capacity of 25 beds defined for highly suspected cases/ contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation testing and provision of basic supportive therapy, HE and maintaining premise hand and respiratory hygiene, we&apos;ll have 6 nurses for each center in this area (2 per 8-hours shift per day)  
3.	Isolation and case management areas with capacity of 17 beds, run by medical (1 MD, 2 nurses per shift in each center) to provide medical assessment and supportive therapy for confirm COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic condition) recovery areas capacity of 8 bed run the same MD and 1 nurse/8hrs shift in each center to provide final assessment and preparation for discharge cases.
We&apos;ll have 1 preparation month to complete recruitments, the required training for the staff, procurement process, contracting, coordination with other partners including QC for receiving the tents and equipment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support Daret Azza and Batbu CBICs in Aleppo District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to Covid-19 outbreak Disease, which is affecting all the world countries, including the Republic of Syria, where Northern West of Syria is still in need of humanitarian relief, considering the health system in NWS is still fragile with urgent need for continuous support.
However, due to the current overcrowded living condition and proportional inefficient housing space for self-isolation in the camps and host communities, Al-Seeraj Organization propose to establish community based Isolation centers, which will offer separate and restrict the movement of the suspected/ confirm COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic condition (lung, heart, renal failure or immuno-compromising condition). The community- based Isolation will run by trained health personnel community health workers and IPC workers and other supportive staff to basic health care services.
Qatar charity will equip the Daret Azza and Batbu Community Based Isolation centers in Aleppo district, with all needed medical and non-medical equipment to be fully functional, while Al-Seeraj Organization with this fund opportunity will support the running cost for five months as first stage.
the supporting plan will be 61,205 USD CBIC/month, as direct cost excluding the Support and in-direct-cost. the activation plan is targeting two CBICs in Aleppo location (Daret Azza and Batbu) for five months.
The Community-Based Isolation will start with 50-bed capacity distributed as follows:
1. observation areas with capacity of 15 beds defined for highly suspected cases/ contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation testing and provision of basic supportive therapy, HE and maintaining premise hand and respiratory hygiene.
2. Isolation and case management areas with capacity of 30 beds, run by medical staff (1 MD, 2-3 nurses per shift) to provide medical assessment and supportive therapy for confirm COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic condition 
3. recovery areas capacity of 5 bed run by 1 doctor and 1 nurse/8hrs shift to provide final assessment and preparation for discharge cases.
this proposal aims to cover all the approximately 91,000 population of the Aleppo targeted areas, by improving access to community isolation services for the most vulnerable group as following: (1) children under eighteen years of age, (2) the elderly, (3) women of reproductive age, (4) IDPs and host communities(5) and people with disabilities, Through our proposed intervention.
Al-Seeraj strategy is to support two Community Based Isolation centers in Aleppo, to be the first point in our intervention providing health services for new suspected/ mild symptoms cases.
this intervention from Al-Seeraj organization was well designed to fill the gaps in the current healthcare services in the targeted areas, in coordination with local authorities and Idlib amp Aleppo health directorates.
the first month will be preparation month to complete recruitment, the required training for the staff on IPC matter, procurement process, contracting, coordination with other partners including QC for receiving the tents and equipment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scaling-up Preparedness and Health Response for COVID-19 in Northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Countries should prepare to respond to different public health scenarios, recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing cases and outbreaks of COVID-19, therefore SEMA by implementing this project will screen and triage patients and introduce the needed care for all suspected and confirmed patients according to disease severity and acute care needs.
The project aims to raise the preparedness and to avoid the delay or lack of appropriate and timely response to COVID-19 spread, through preparing an isolation/intensive care center in Idleb governorate (Idleb sub-district) to receive the confirmed or suspected cases.
SEMA, through the support and partnership with SCHF, will provide the aforementioned center with the needed equipment including but not limited to (ICU beds, CBC apparatus, Biosystem Apparatus, Electrolytes Apparatus, ABG Apparatus, X-Ray Machine) where the center will have the capacity to receive people in need for case management services either through preparation of the center and developing the triage procedures or by promoting isolation of people with mild respiratory symptoms to reduce the burden on health system.
The aforementioned supply chain Items, will be complementary to what SEMA has provided previously SEMA has secured 40 hospitalization beds to be in place, and 5 ventilators, and will assure the capacity by filling the gap through SCHF proposed project (SEMA has the resources to purchase 5 additional ventilators, complementary to 10 ICU beds secured through this project.
The center will have the capacity to receive 60 patients through the 60 available beds, in addition to 10 ICU beds and 10 ventilators, where 3 ICU specialists, 6 General Doctors, and 3 ICU Technicians and 29 nurses will be hired to work in the center, taking into consideration the ability to raise this capacity if situation becomes worse. SEMA has communicated with TF and Idleb health directorate to add the proposed hospital to the plan and map of services in Idleb governorate.
Also, through this project SEMA will secure one oxygen station and oxygen cylinders compressor, where the two devices were recommended by Idlib Health Directorate and WHO health cluster Gaziantep hub. These two devices will support patients with respiratory complications to get healed, where providing oxygenation for these patients has a vital role in their survival.
During the project period the staff will be trained on the following topics: Basic Life Support (BLS), Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) in addition to the Case Management of the suspected or infected cases, and they will be provided with personal protection equipment (PPE) including masks, gloves eye-shield and gowns.
Furthermore, SEMA, in coincidence with procurement process which includes securing the equipment, medication and consumable, will conduct the required rehabilitation for the center in addition to finalizing the recruitment of the staff, taking into consideration activating emergency procurement thresholds, to decrease the period needed to launch the activities fully, with commitment to start the implementation with available resources (provided by SEMA), and run fully after accomplishing all procurement.
Meanwhile, SEMA has managed to initiate on CBI center in Kafartakharim earlier of April, the center has been equipped and get into active service as one of referral centers in NWS in coordination with TF and IHD. This center will be fully supported by SEMA other resources, with capacity of 20 isolation beds, and 5 ICU beds with ventilators, and has been provided with medication and consumables and PPE  which will be enough for one active month, SEMA through this project will propose to support Kafartakharim hospital with sufficient amounts of PPE to fill the gab after one month of the outbreak.
Finally, SEMA is committed for conducting telemedicine by advisors outside Syria through the whole project period.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Operating and management of  two community based isolation centers in Idleb governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the 6-months project at hand, Violet aims to contribute to the joint efforts of the COVID-19 taskforce and preparedness plan through equiping and operating two community-based isolation centers (CBI) in Idleb and Kafer takharim in Idleb governorate with a capacity of 50 beds each to receive and accommodate the suspected/detected cases of COVID-19 in Idleb governorate. Where basically home care may have considered for those presenting with mild illness, hospitalization may not be required unless there is concern about rapid deterioration. However, due to the current overcrowded living condition and potential inefficient housing space for self-isolation in the camps and host communities, this project proposes to operate community-based Isolation, which will contribute to isolate the suspected and confirmed cases and restrict their movement.  The community- based Isolation will be operated by trained health personnel community health workers and IPC workers and other support staff to basic health care services.

The 2 centers will be supported by Violet in coordination with WHO, Health Cluster Task Force and Idleb health directorate and will be receiving the suspected/ detected cases referred by a specialized center with COVID-19. 

The community isolation center CBI will be designed in accordance with WHO guidelines where each center will be equipped with 50 beds allocated for both men and women, and the women section will be operated by female nurses and staff taking into consideration the privacy of female patients. The 50 beds distributed as following:

1. Observation areas with a capacity of 15 beds defined for highly suspected cases/ contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation testing and provision of basic supportive therapy, HE and maintaining premise hand and respiratory hygiene. 
 
2. Isolation and case management areas with a capacity of 30 beds, run by medical (1 MD, 23 nurses per shift) to provide medical assessment and supportive therapy for confirming COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic condition  
 
3. Recovery areas capacity of 5 bed run by an on-call doctor and 1 nurse/8hrs shift to provide final assessment and preparation for discharge cases.  

Moreover, Violet will ensure the centers are managed and operated by a sufficient and well-trained medical and non-medical staff to maintain the center and patients sanitized and keep centers clean to prevent the infection spreading among staff and patients. Additionally, The CBI will also provide services other than treatment like (food, internet basic needs &#x2026; etc)

This project is supplementing and complementing Violet&#x2019;s current COVID-19 response, in which Violet emergency plan has key priorities: 1) hygiene awareness and hygiene kits for the target group, 2) training Violet&#x2019;s volunteers on how to handle a potential COVID-19 outbreak and 3) equipping existing health infrastructure and staff with required materials to be prepared for a potential outbreak. Moreover, Violet has dedicated 5 ambulance vehicles and 35 paramedics to transport suspected cases.

However, this project would largely contribute to ensuring the professional handling of a potential outbreak and mitigate the risk of infection through the community. Additionally, this project is complementing Violet&#x2019;s emergency response in the targeted areas.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 Response Related Supply Chain Support</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the 22 April 2020 dated &apos;Northwest Syria Task Force Situation Update&apos;, there have not yet been any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Northwest Syria. The World Health Organization through the coordination of UNOCHA and the Health Cluster based out of Gaziantep have put into action the &apos;COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan&#x2019; to ensure that the humanitarian community takes the necessary steps in preparing for any COVID-19 related eventuality. Even though the limited number of laboratory tests conducted so far have not produced any COVID-19 positive results, this does not negate the fact that Northwest Syria is classified as a &#x2018;High Risk&#x2019; area in terms of the COVID-19 epidemic, as stated by the World Health Organization. 

The global COVID-19 outbreak has led to a great imbalance of the supply and demand dynamics of acutely needed COVID-19 response related medical supplies and equipment. These supplies and equipment include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE&#x2019;s) as well as ICU ventilators.

This project aims to support the COVID-19 response related supply chain of the international humanitarian community under the framework of the strategic principles put forward under the Northwest Syria COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan.

The project will thus procure within Turkey and deliver to World Health Organization (WHO) warehouse in Northwest Syria vital COVID-19 response related medical equipment and materials. These medical supplies will then be distributed to beneficiaries in Northwest Syria by the WHO. These medical equipment and materials will be consisting of Personal Protective Equipment as well as ventilators for medical staff working in the front lines of the COVID-19 response in Northwestern Syria.

As decided in coordination with the Health Cluster, the composition of the Personel Protective Equipment will be as follows: 1.300.000 units of 3 Layer Surgical Masks, 200.000 units of EN149 / FFP2 Masks, 100.000 units of Protective Suits, 27.000 units of Safety Goggles, 1.100.000 units of Powder-Free Nitrile Gloves. In addition 35 units of ICU ventilators will also be procured and delivered  to health facilities in need across the border in Northern Syria.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supply Chain Support for Covid-19 Response in Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Health Organization through the coordination of UNOCHA and all of the sector clusters based out of Gaziantep have put into action the &apos;COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan&#x2019; to ensure that the humanitarian community takes the necessary steps in preparing for any COVID-19 related eventuality. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Response Update Number 6, as of 19 June, 2020, approximately 4 million people including 2.7 million IDP&#x2019;s are in need of humanitarian related assistance. The WHO states that the overall risk of transmission remains high due to a number of risk factors, which include but are not limited to high density in a relatively confined amount of space, close proximity of living quarters with limited access to WASH facilities as well as the health care system&#x2019;s existing limitations due to prolonged effects of conflict. 
Even though the limited number of laboratory tests conducted have not resulted in any COVID-19 positive results in Northwest Syria, this does not negate the fact that Northwest Syria is classified as a &#x2018;High Risk&#x2019; area in terms of the COVID-19 epidemic, as stated by the WHO.
The global COVID-19 outbreak has led to a great imbalance of the supply and demand dynamics of acutely needed COVID-19 response related medical supplies and equipment. These supplies and equipment include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE&#x2019;s) as well as ICU ventilators and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Units (CPAP) devices.
This project aims to support the COVID-19 response related supply chain of the international humanitarian community under the framework of the strategic principles put forward under the Syria COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan. The pandemic threat of this magnitude requires collective solidarity since the virus is threatening the humanity as whole. Thus, in order to minimize the effects of the pandemic, a global response plan is needed to fight with the virus, save lives and help contain the spread of the virus worldwide. 
With the above stated sensitivities in mind, the project will thus procure within Turkey and deliver to WHO / UNOCHA designated warehouses in Northern Syria vital COVID-19 response related medical equipment and materials. These COVID-19 related PPE&#x2019;s are subject to certain legislative limitations in terms of their export from Turkey to third countries. The Turkish Red Crescent will thus get an exceptional permission from the Turkish Ministry of Health as a part of this project in order to facilitate the procured items across the border as a contribution to international humanitarian assistance efforts. These items will be delivered to UNOCHA / WHO designated warehouses in Northern Syria. 
Under this framework the final recipient locations will be two warehouse as stated above, one for those crossing the &#xD6;ncup&#x131;nar / Bab Al Salam (BAS) and one for those crossing the Cilveg&#xF6;z&#xFC; / Bab Al Hawa (BAH) border crossings. The post-delivery distribution phase of the PPE&#x2019;s, ICU Ventilators as well as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Units (CPAP) will be the responsibility of the WHO / UNOCHA partners.  
In case requested by WHO / UNOCHA, the Turkish Red Crescent will also provide warehouse storage assistance for the PPE&#x2019;s, ICU Ventilators as well as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Units in Turkey and transportation services for their final delivery to the designated warehouses in Syria. The timeline for the delivery of the items into Syria will be decided jointly between TRC, WHO and UNOCHA. 
As decided in coordination with UNOCHA and all of the sector clusters, the composition of the Personal Protective Equipment will be as follows: 52.380 units of Apron Disposable, 37.620 units of Face Shields, 8.131.200 units of Nitrile Examination Gloves, 13.629 units of Protective Goggles, units of 159.390 units of Protective Gowns, 8.547.000 units of Medical Masks, 73 units of ICU Ventilators and 15 units of Continous Positive Airway Pressure Unit.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support cross-border operations from Turkey into Syria to tap into sources of information and share it for use by the humanitarian community through a team of humanitarian field officers in NSAG-controlled areas. The team will be managed by the HFOs management team based in Gaziantep, Turkey in consultation with OCHA Turkey. The project is designed to broadly support the formal coordination system, especially the clusters/ICCG, as It is based on four pillars
1-Information gathering
This pillar focuses on gathering data from the ground to produce reports about the humanitarian situation and context and inform response and advocacy. The data is shared with the OCHA coordination unit for use in various platforms and products. Info on unmet needs, including urgent cases, will be shared with clusters to address
2-Support to monitoring of SCHF funded projects
The HFOs will monitor projects funded by the SCHF. These monitoring missions will be conducted upon the request of the SCHF and based on SCHF monitoring criteria. Monitoring of SCHF projects directly improves the quality and accountability of the inter-cluster response, as projects funded by the SCHF are reviewed through the clusters
3-Community Engagement
The HFOs and the HFAs will conduct community engagement to strengthen humanitarian response through facilitating meetings with the affected community and the humanitarian community and other,  stakeholders obtaining feedback from the community on their needs and the response and providing info to affected people through awareness sessions and other means on the humanitarian response and the community&#x2019;s rights and role in it. Community engagement informs the overall inter-cluster response and in some cases is organized on behalf of clusters
4-Service Mapping
A service mapping application for mobile phones will be maintained that provides IDPs, local communities, and humanitarian actors with information on the availability of services in different locations with the aim of facilitating access to services and assisting humanitarian actors in planning. This will provide info on services (camp locations, bakeries, clean water resources, health facilities, protection, etc.), whether provided by humanitarian or non-humanitarian entities, so that people will be able to access them. The application will include a special part for awareness-raising which would play an important role in the COVID 19 prevention campaign and can also be used for Mine Risk Awareness and similar issues. Trainings and humanitarian job postings can also be posted in the app. Clusters provide much of the info on services in the app
The project builds on the outcomes of a previous project completed earlier in 2020. The info-gathering component is well-established and in recent months the mechanism for sharing specific needs data with clusters was streamlined and has resulted in individual cases receiving assistance. This system will be expanded in the new project. SCHF monitoring activities carried out so far have been well-received, resulting in one of the HFOs becoming largely dedicated to this work and the processes for monitoring becoming more formalized which will be further enhanced. Direct engagement with communities facilitated by the HFOs has allowed senior leadership, including the ERC, to provide high-level advocacy from key constituencies including women and PWDs, which will continue. The service mapping app was created after gaps were identified in providing info on services to people in need during large displacements. It was recently launched and it has been well-received by people in need, clusters, and other stakeholders. Building on this success, it now needs to be expanded to include more communities and contain more information, for which focal point assistants inside Syria will gather data for the application and conduct related local outreach.
HFOs training and visits log will be attached to the proposal.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the proposed intervention is to improve school-aged children&#x2019;s access to safe, inclusive and quality learning environments in order to foster their resilience. This will be achieved through a holistic approach providing support to formal schools as well as incorporating psychosocial support activities (PSS). PIN will provide a package of integrated activities to 7 primary and secondary formal schools (9 shifts), where 4,791 children (1,917 boys and 2,874 girls) are enrolled (23% IDPs). By supporting a quality-learning environment, PIN aims to discourage drop-out and increase meaningful learning as well as increase enrollment of out-of-school children (OOSC). To achieve this, PIN will provide appropriate teaching and learning materials as well as recreational materials. PIN will cover the school&apos;s operational costs, including fuel for heating during the winter months, in order to secure the functioning of schools and to create a safe and child-friendly environment. Awareness and outreach campaigns will be conducted to reach out-of-school children and their families, with a focus on identifying and removing the barriers to increase enrollment and attendance of the most vulnerable groups. The quality of education will be improved through contextualized and targeted teacher training and further support to their professional development within each school. Monthly incentives will be provided to all educational personnel to increase their motivation and ensure their retention in schools. PSS will be a fundamental part of the project aiming to improve the well-being and learning capacity of children and teachers, who are traumatized by the war benefiting both in-school and out-of-school children. Adapting to the context of COVID-19 school closures, PIN is proposing a tested mobile-based methodology to be used in case further school closures persist. To prepare for the schools&#x2019; re-opening, the essential component of remedial classes is also incorporated into the project design, to support children with closing the gap in their knowledge and skills the distance methodology may have created for some of them. PIN will also strengthen its referral system through service mapping and training on the identification and referral of children with protection risks and child protection.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve conflict-and-displacement affected girls&#x2019; and boys&#x2019; access to education services which protect, support wellbeing and improve educational outcomes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to provide immediate, lifesaving educational access to formal/non formal education combined with social emotional learning/ PSS activities, physically in schools or through distance modalities  to 7,357 children, (89.8% IDPs, 10.2% Host community) 4.089 girls, 3,268 boys, 193 CwD) in Idlib and Rural Aleppo in NW Syria from July 1st until June 2021 in 26 learning spaces. The focus is on increasing access and improving the quality of education as well as safety and COVID-19 preparedness and mitigations.

To ensure teacher well being and high performance, SR will provide teacher incentives, teacher kits, internet for connection, materials to provide SLP to children with no access to internet, and ongoing learning using a package of contextualized trainings and capacity buildings to assist them to deliver quality education, as well as through monthly learning circles at each school. Supervision and coaching channels will be used to monitor implementation and provide continuous support. 

To secure child well being and participation, SR will provide recreational materials, student stationary bags and internet for children to access online education and exercise books/SLP materials for children with no access to online education. Children who have access to smart phones and the ones who don&#x2019;t will benefit through adaptable modalities (SLP - Online platforms) based on the formal curriculum.  In addition, SR will provide PSS/ SEL as a fundamental part of the project aiming to improve the wellbeing and learning capacity of children, who are traumatized by years of war and isolation. Teachers in this project will focus on social and emotional 5 competencies through online distance platforms and SLP after adapting the activities, using only those that can be delivered remotely. During the COVID-19 situation, SR will continue providing children with distance learning, through which children will continue learning. SR will provide increased catch up, recreational activities and SEL in the summer and in the first two weeks lock down is over to compensate for the time lost in the 2019/2020 academic year by schools that closed due to conflict and/or COVID-19. This will facilitate integration back to formal learning (see summer activity and SEL activity handbook annex). In the 2020/2021 school year, formal education with be provided with supplementary basic literacy and numeracy classes to support children in the areas of their study they are falling behind in or find problematic and improve their learning outcomes
To guarantee mobilizing the community to deliver this education to the children, teachers will pay regular visits to parents to give them regular weekly/biweekly plans and will follow up separately with children and teachers. Once suspension finishes, Back to Learning (BTL) campaigns will be conducted to increase awareness on the importance of education and to promote a return to learning. Awareness and outreach campaigns will be conducted with a focus on identifying and removing barriers to increase enrolment and attendance of the most vulnerable groups and with main COVID-19 messages that SR will be providing through online platforms and other methods
To improve the learning environment, SR will do small rehabilitation as needed (e.g. gender/disability sensitive WASH facilities), provide school furniture, and cover school operational costs, including fuel for heating in winter.

In terms of emergency preparedness and COVID-19 response, the emergency preparedness plans include disaster reduction information, emergency evacuation plans and drills, and school-level checklists of tasks to improve preparedness. COVID-19 awareness will be mainstreamed through awareness sessions, sterilizing of schools, and for children, activities, such as storytelling in distance learning, readings, online brochures, etc. SR will use schools as a window of knowledge and sharing to spread awareness in the community</narrative>

The project targets 13,400 conflict-affected children (6,625 girls, 6,775 boys, ~ 536 CwD ~4%, 5-17 years old) and 600 teachers and educational personnel (300 Women , 300 Men) in areas with the highest severity (5, 6) of needs in Idleb Governorate, with an aim to increase the capacity of Education sector in coping with the potential outbreak of COVID-19 and prevent the children from dropping-out. The project has two components:

First, Improve Schools Capacity to rapidly cope with the threat of potential pandemic outbreak
===============
Adopting COVID-19 prevention measures to provide healthy, and hygienic learning environment  in 14 formal schools benefiting 13,400 children (6,625 girls, 6,775 boys, ~ 536 CwD ~4%, 5 -17 years old) through a comprehensive hygiene measures that include A) conduct minor rehabilitation of Schools&#x2019; WC units, B) conduct weekly sterilization, C)  provide the schools with the essential supplies and equipment (based on WHO guidelines) , D) provide trainings the janitors on how to do the sterilization, and E) conduct hygiene awareness sessions ttargeting both children and adults, to introduce and promote the hygiene best practices in schools.

Second, Increase Access to Quality and Protective Formal Education
===============
Targeting 5,800 children (2,868 girls, 2,932 boys, ~4% CwD, 5-17 years old) in 7 Formal Schools in Maaret-Tamsrin, Qourqeena, Dana, and Idleb districts. (Attached Schools Details.xlsx) 
The activities are:
1) Conducti BTL campaigns to increase the awareness among parents and local communities on the importance of education and how to be protected from epidemics. The campaigns include gender-sensitive and child-friendly awareness-raising activities, community mobilization, and community outreach. Taking in consideration the recommended prevention measures on COVID-19 during these activities.
2) Deliver classes and exams as per the academic calendar, using SiG curriculum. To decrease the numbers of children in one classroom a new shiftwill be introduced. Each school will be provided with required Operational Supplies: Recreational kits, Supplies for PSS Activities, Stationary, Supplementary Materials, and Winterization for classrooms heating. Children will undergo pre and post learning assessment to measure their improvement. 
3) Conduct structured PSS and Social and Emotional Learning programs via daily sessions using War Child&#x2019;s &#x201C;I DEAL&#x201D;.
4) Promote community engagement by activating the role of PTAs in improving and monitoring the project activities.  
5) Conduct 6-days Capacity Building programs, to enhance quality of education, benefiting 298 teachers and staff (132 Men, 166 Women) in the targeted schools.
6) Conduct an in-school integration activities targeting CwD via CwD-inclusion-officers in partnership with SANAD NGO which is specialized in CwD Cases. 
All 7 schools will have an established AAP/PSEA reporting channel as per UNICEF Guidelines. The channels will be introduced to children and adults (parents and teachers) to be more familiar with it and confident to use it.


PLAN B
===============
The schools are expected to reopen and operate normally by the start of the academic year 20/21, but as a plan B, and to decrease the educational loss of schools&#x2019; suspension, the project will adapt the remote learning modality, and provide children with internet vouchers (cost will be taken from classroom heating). Teachers will receive capacity building on remote education techniques.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support formal and non-formal education in North West Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support formal and non-formal education for 13888 dropped-out children (boys &#x2013; girls)or who are at risk of dropping out of school (aged 5-17, 6110 B and 7778 G, 9792 IDPs and 4096 HCs) through supporting 13 schools which their fund will be ended during June and July 2020. The project also works on expanding schools&apos; capacity so that they are able to receive more displaced children and to reduce classroom crowding as a response to Covid-19 pandemic, where those schools are located in concentration points for IDPs in Dana, Idleb and A&apos;zaz communities.
-During summer (July and Aug), compensatory and supplementary lessons will be provided from the adopted government curriculum to assist 4554 children (1621 B, 2933 G) in Dana and Idleb to get back to the level of their grades after such challenging period of studying, in addition to providing PSS sessions to help children (boys &#x2013; girls) to overcome the challenges and circumstances they passed during last months.
-During 20-21 academic year, formal and non-formal education will be provided in targeted 13 schools as follow:
Provision of two cycle non-formal education through catch-up and remedial classes for 1950 out of schools&#x2019; children (boys &#x2013; girls) and low-leveled students using curriculum B, cycle&apos;s duration is 4 months. Students who pass ASER test will be given a certificate of completion so that they can continue their learning process as formal students
-Supporting formal education for 11938 children (5135 B, 6803 G) by providing operational costs, learning and teaching materials, schools&#x2019; supplies, and heating materials, in addition to providing weekly PSS sessions to overcome the harsh experience of war conditions and to motivate them continuing their studies at schools.
-In order to increase access to children to the targeted schools, project will work on increasing schools&apos; absorption capacities by conducting light rehabilitation for damaged/unused classrooms based on accurate need assessment, in addition to providing TLSs to decrease overcrowding and facilitate social distancing and to receive new students.
-To ensure safe and easy access for CwD (boys and girls), Takaful will provide schools with tools and equipment for CwD such ramps, Iron stair handrails, special toilet, not connected desks and chairs with height adjustable function in addition to providing transportation for CwD, taking into account that Takaful was distributed 9 out of 13 targeted schools with these tools in previous projects.
-Takaful will work to conduct awareness sessions to minimize the spread of Corona Virus for all staffs and students, together with sterilizing all schools before students get in.
-The project will provide 288 teachers and education personnel (173 M/115 F) with incentives in Dana and Idleb schools, as A&apos;zaz schools already receive teachers&apos; incentives from other party.
-To ensure best community engagement, meetings will be held with local actors (males and females) of the targeted locations in order to describe project&apos;s goal and hear their recommendation and collect detailed 
information about the specific locations of dropping out children and the reasons of their dropping out and their needs.
-Plan B:  
* In case of continued schools&apos; suspension due to the Corona pandemic, Takaful will go to distance learning methods (as it&apos;s currently used) by setting up WhatsApp groups that include all classroom&apos;s students together with teachers and followed up by educational personnel in the school, where lessons are given through audio and video clips which are published on groups. Students&apos; questions are received through those groups and they are answer at the same time. 
* if we weren&apos;t able to reach some schools or they received support from another NGO, by selecting schools with the same criteria in the target districts or other sub-districts, where we have full access.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of relevant quality learning opportunities for affected children in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project supports children in Idleb and Aleppo from the host community and IDPs which includes the most vulnerable groups (children under 12 years, IDPs children, children with disabilities) to provide equitable access for quality learning opportunities for girls and boys in both for primary and secondary school level in both formal and non-formal settings. The implementation approach will be focusing on the adoption of the education program in Voilet to ensure the continuity of education and provide access to learning opportunities before, during, and after COVID-19 by delivering quality education in the existing formal and non-formal learning spaces in the targeted locations that have been either complete cessation or substantial reduction in non-earmarked funding support to the education based on the result of the education need assessment conducted by Violet&apos;s team in those locations. The project design complies with INEE minimum standards and safe-programming principles for children to ensure that children have access to inclusive and equitable quality education that provides opportunities for lifelong learning.  

Violet aims to achieve the overall change (the impact) we want to have is improved student resilience and learning outcomes &#x2013; specifically, improved resilience for up to 7,770 children (50 percent girls) with at least 50 percent achieving improved basic learning outcomes through: 
- The provision of distance learning with PSS amp SEL activities during COVID-19 response until the beginning of the academic year in September 2020
- The provision of incentives has a positive impact on teacher attendance and retention
- Return to the normal eduction after COVID-19 response, provision of formal education with complementary remedial and catch-up classes which ends by re-entering the students into formal education after a short-term intervention
- The  Ongoing teacher professional development and support which effectively equip teachers with the skills to provide protective and quality education in the supported learning spaces online during COVD-19 and in-person after it.
- Enhanced participation by children, parents, and communities in supporting children&#x2019;s education and protection
- Provide support for children with more significant functioning problems, ensure to implement the RECU design in the education facilities (Reach, Enter, Circulate, Use) to fully mainstream disability in education
- PSS (Psychosocial Support) and SEL (Social and Emotional Learning) activities (through PSS facilitators online communicating with families
- Implement comprehensive health and hygiene protocols and awareness-raising
- Conduct safeguarding activities and scale up a suite of activities designed to help keep children safe including emergency preparedness and response activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project target 7 schools in 7 communities in Idleb (Salqin, Dana, Qourqeena), these schools were supported under SCHF project (12682) in the period between 12-6-2019 to 11-6-2020, and the two proposed phases are:
1-During COVID-19: although there are no confirmed cases in NW Syria, it is expected that this phase will last until September 2020, during this period we propose the provision of remedial classes and as schools are closed it is a better time for conduct some maintenance and rehab:
-Provision of remedial classes to children who couldn&#x2019;t attend and/or finalize the last semester properly because of the last displacement from Dec19 to the end of Feb20, and the closure of schools starting from the mid of March20,  children might be are at risk of dropping out or have poor education score according to their level of education, the proposed targeted children is 4578 (2223 B, 2355 G), GAN will provide PSS and SEL activities to children through online system and communications using WhatsApp groups if the schools still closed or physically if it is opend, and online training about Google services (YouTube, Forms, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Gmail, Drive, Classrooms) will be provided to teachers to help them deal with distance learning modality, as some other required tools for schools like(mics, tripod for mobiles, internet packages..etc), children will be provided with monthly internet packages, the 9th and 12th grade exams will be supported that will take place in July 20 (through provision of needed human resources and running cost for schools).
During the displacement period, 5 out of 7 targeted schools were occupied by IDPs, and this affected the furniture of schools in general, so light maintenance and rehabilitation will be provided, the scope of rehab will include the classrooms (windows and doors) as WASH facilities and ensure that all are adapted to receive children with disabilities, in addition, to repair school furniture like (students&#x2019; desks, Cupboard, teachers&#x2019; tables, and whiteboards), these rehab activities will improve and increase the safe access to schools and ensure children are receiving education in a safe and protected environment, as parents might not send their children to schools due to the inappropriate school condition. Rehabilitating schools will be as preparedness for after COVID-19 phase and make sure that school absorption capacity is increased by activating 6 classrooms in 2 schools also.

2-After COVID-19: provision of formal and education for the 7 schools, the targeted schools are the same target in the summer phase and accommodate about 5400 students including (2580 B, 2820 G), GAN will conduct BTL campaigns in the 7 targeted communities before starting the academic year to raise awareness about the importance of education for both boys, girls and flag the risks of not enrolling children in schools, as send so key messages about hygiene, after that ASER test will be conducted to help us better plan and focus on the needed type of educational activities based on ASER results, also to capture the impact of the intervention, children will be provided with learning materials (bag, stationery, notebooks..etc.) according to the gender and age and children will be trained on the safety and security plans, the PSS activities will be provided for all students, one session a week following the CP-sub cluster guidelines and referral pathways in addition to, the protection staff will be trained on CP minimum standards, teacher and education personnel will be provided with incentives and teaching and learning materials, the curriculum used is SIG and high level of coordination with ED and other working organization will be ensured to avoid duplications, the whole project activities will be implemented following the EiE, INEE guidelines and CHPs</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-sustaining equitable education and learning opportunities for crisis-affected girls/boys in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at providing 14208 crisis-affected children (6678 boys, 7530 girls, age and sex disaggregated as done in the needs assessment) safe access to life-sustaining equitable non-formal and formal education services provided within a protective and child-friendly environment in 16 schools in Idleb (Armanaz, Dana, Harim, Qourqeena, and Salqin) and Aleppo (Al-Bab) Governorates, with protection activities mainstreamed.

The project will provide learning opportunities for these students during and after COVID-19, to ensure continuity of children&#x2019;s education, as follows:

1. Non-Formal Education will be provided for 1536 school children (722 boys, 814 girls aged 5-17yrs) in 4 learning centers in Idleb governorate through a distance learning modality by creation of WhatsApp groups to maintain due communication between teachers and children, where contacts of the parents/caregivers of the students will be obtained and groups in WhatsApp created to provide instructions and check in on children&#x2019;s progress at home.
Shafak estimates (as per lessons learnt from ongoing distance learning interventions) to reach around 70% of targeted children (1076) with distance learning, while the remaining children (460) who are unable to participate within the WhatsApp Group created, given their inaccessibility to smartphones, will be reached regular bi-weekly home based visits to follow up their progress, to maintain the Do No Harm principle, and to make sure no child is left behind. (please see attached Distance Learning Modality document for further elaboration).
These online classes will start immediately and run in 1 cycle in the summer to allow transition to formal education in the beginning of the school year 2020/2021. Self-Learning Program (SLP) books (provided from a secured fund by Shafak) will be distributed, taking into consideration April 2020 cluster guide note and WHO guidelines for distribution. (please see attached Shafak updated distribution SoPs for education supplies).

2. Formal education services will be provided for 12,672 school children (5956 boys, 6716 girls aged 5-17yrs) in 12 schools in Idleb and Aleppo governorates at the beginning of the school year 2020/2021 following the normal classroom modality (with plans set for transition back to distance learning modality, based on developments of COVID 19 on the ground).

3. Psycho-social Support (PSS) sessions will be conducted aiming at providing parents and caregivers with tips about how crucial it is to connect emotionally with children, understand their concerns, be aware of any situation leading to violence and abuse, and to thereby create an environment which is as normalized and joyful as it can possibly be.

4. Repair of learning spaces will be made to classrooms, gender-sensitive and disability-friendly WASH facilities on a small scale as needed in line with WASH sector guidelines. Contractors will be engaged through a local tender process that follows Shafak standards and procedures. 

5. Professional Development: Teaching staff will be delivered online trainings on signs of distress to enable them to identify and refer children who may have specific child protection needs. The trainings aim at supporting teachers with ways of identification and referral of children who could access education.

6. Shafak ensures that recruited staff and education personnel are not paid by any other party.

The project targets schools according to needs assessment and in coordination with education stakeholders and partners to make sure they are not supported and to prevent any overlap in the provision of services.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children (SC), in partnership with Ihsan for Relief and Development (IRD), will implement an integrated education and child protection intervention targeted at vulnerable children and their caregivers, with a particular focus on those most affected by the impact of COVID-19. 

SC will target host and IDP communities in Idlib and Aleppo governorates in NW Syria with an integrated Child Protection (CP) and Education in Emergency (EiE) program focusing on continuing to reach Out-of-School- Children (OOSC) in community-based learning spaces, with pathways for children into certified curriculum tracks and complementary protection services. SC and IRD will reach 2,600 displaced and vulnerable school age children with formal and non-formal education services, through static and mobile Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS&#x2019;) and teachers, both delivering remote learning modalities. The Child Protection interventions will be implemented in the areas prioritized by the CP cluster (Harim and Jebel Seman) and will focus on continuing the existing child protection case management and supporting community based protection mechanisms, including through Child Friendly Spaces, PSS activities and awareness raising on CP and COVID related issues.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support and strengthen access to livelihoods by creating  income-generating opportunities through CFW and participatory irrigation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violet is proposing an integrated 7-months project to 1) strengthen access for vulnerable groups to livelihood opportunities, and 2) improve access to basic services and infrastructure. For a sustainable approach, Violet also 3) supports participatory irrigation via solar-powered systems. 

FSC activities
1. 1738 households have improved access to income-generating activities through CFW activities (100% female) through olive harvesting activities for 1months in Albab and Jarablus (1.580 unskilled and 158 skilled labor), the planned number of trees to be harvested is 79.000 trees where the productivity of each worker is around 2.4 trees per day in Northern Aleppo. The expected number of farmers is 265 by considering the average landholding is 300 trees. To ensure sustainability, 50% of the CFW workers&apos; transportation costs will be covered from the contribution of farmers benefitting from olive harvesting. Additionally, they will provide the necessary harvesting tools.
2. 265 BNF farmers (benefitting from olives harvesting) will have improved access to cultivation skills and knowledge through provision online training on GAP. 
3. Installing 15 solar-powered irrigation systems targeting at least 120 households in Jarablus are installed to provide water for vegetable, crops, and olive trees production. The mobile irrigation systems cover an area of approximately 3.5 hectares each. Targeting the lands that are far away up to 5 km from the riverside and have seepage water. BNFs will be trained on how to operate and maintain the irrigation system to ensure sustainability.
Violet will ensure the integration by targeting the same BNFs with the above-mentioned activities whenever applicable. So, olive farmers having land far from Euphrates river (up to 5 KM) in Jarablus will receive harvesting and irrigation services and GAP training. Moreover, Violet will link the participatory irrigation BNFs with the previously trained BNFs on solar irrigation maintenance in the same location to be able to support each other. Solar irrigation systems will support BNF farmers with sustainable, clean and free energy to reduce production and irrigation costs, and thus, improve their income.

ERL activities 
3.  440 households have strengthened access to livelihoods through CFW opportunities for 3 months/ rounds (400 unskilled and 40 skilled workers) and improving access to public infrastructure by conducting minor rehabilitation to roads, sewage systems, sidewalk, and gardens. through this activity, Violet will ensure the active community participation in all phases. Activities will be identified based on the needs, community priorities, the number of target BNFs and budget limitation. Moreover, the CFW activities under ERL will effectively contribute to the COVID-19 response through cleaning and disinfecting public facilities, garbage collection, rehabilitating of the sewage systems, and water networks. 
While the solar irrigation system was selected to ensure the suitability, CFW modality was selected to improve the community&apos;s resilience,  allow BNFs to participate in their communities&apos; development, and secure their needs in a dignified and flexible way, but also to reduce the reliance on humanitarian assistance through creating short term job opportunities. it also contributes to market recovery through disposing of cash in the BNFs hands
As active member in the different clusters, Violet coordinates with the other actors and systematic reporting to the relevant cluster. E.g. garbage collection will be coordinated and reported to the WASH cluster.
Beside cash distribution, each CFW BNF will receive 750 G of soap sufficient for 1 month to contribute to COVID-19 response based on WASH cluster recommendations.
Violet is ready to immediately start the implementation since it has active FWA for MTA service for CFW payments.

Violet commits to apply COVID-19 preventive measures, accountability and SEA mitigation measures in all activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing livelihood opportunities and improve access to social services to conflict-affected populations in Aleppo governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to contribute to the improved resilience of conflict-affected populations in Northwest Syria by enhancing access to livelihood opportunities and basic services for women and men in Qabasin area, Al-Bab and Arima subdistricts, Aleppo governorate. IYD will achieve this objective by the implementation of the following integrated activities :

1-	support 200- selected HHs with vocational training, including four types of training courses determined based on the needs assessment conducted by IYD in the targeted community. Accordingly, IYD will implement the following trainings:

	To decrease the impact of COVID-19, training on home manufacturing of soap and general sewing ( including masks) will be conducted to 100 selected trainees (50 trainees per training type), and by the end of the training, the best ten of them will receive productive tool kits to launch their own business.

	 The other types of training will be on soft skills of data management and Ms office for 100 trainees to raise the targeted trainees&#x2019; chances in securing long-term job opportunities. IYD, after this training, will recruit the best ten trainees for two months in IYD and other NGOs operating in the targeted areas, obtaining the practical experience, and IYD will pay their salaries as a business grant. 

Each of these trainings will last for one month (20 working days/4-hour duration daily), and the trainees will be required to attend a minimum of 80% of the sessions. It is important to state that IYD, which has developed biosecurity and contingency plans to alleviate the COVID 19 risk, will apply and highly take into consideration all preventive measures recommended by the health cluster. Of them, small training groups, physical distancing, wearing masks and gloves, availability of disinfection machines and sanitation items, etc. Besides, the woman trainees will be provided with child care service within a dedicated room within the center run by a female babysitter. 

2-	IYD will conduct two community support activities that improve the whole community&#x2019;s access to basic services and assist Qabasin population.

Based on need assessment discussed in the needs section of this proposal, the population in Qabasin community is suffering from damaged roads that connect the farmers to markets in the city center and damaged sewage. To address that, IYD will conduct the following activities:
	IYD will rehabilitate 12 KM of roads in Qabasin and surrounding areas. These roads are connecting farmers to markets this will reduce the financial burden on farmers by decreasing the depreciation of their vehicles and minimize the transportation cost of production from farms to markets.

	Likewise, IYD will rehabilitate the damaged sewage system in Qabasin community because the sewage water accumulates near the houses, and this causes diseases and bad smells.  

3-	Provision of Cash for Work to vulnerable households:

By this activity, IYD will provide temporary job opportunities in the form of cash for work modality for 500 selected beneficiaries, and these workers will implement community activities as follow:

	50-targeted workers will receive training on preventive measures against COVID-19, then they will work as promoters in markets to raise the populat&#x131;on awareness about COVID-19  preventive measures.

	450-skilled and unskilled workers will work in the above-mentioned community support activities (rehabilitation of roads and sewage system and other community activities)
.
Here is important to mention that IYD will sign contracts with targeted workers to determine the start date of work, daily work hours, contract duration, daily wages, type of activity ( according to IYD cash for work SoPs, the targeted worker should works 7 hours daily for 22 days per month). Besides, IYD determines $ 7.5 for skilled workers per day, while the unskilled worker will receive $ 6 per day accordin</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Agriculture based livelihood support for the vulnerable Syrians</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project seeks to improve the livelihood situation of 1,050 households (5,309 individuals) through livestock and agricultural support in Harim District of Idleb Governorates. The project is developed based on the primary need assessment conducted through focus group discussions and key informant interviews in Eleven communities including Merat Elshalaf, Sardin, Kafr Hind, Tellemar, Saidiyeh, Abu Talha, Allani, Hamziyeh, , Tilaada, Selwa, Hezreh in Idleb Governorate. 
Islamic Relief will conduct a detailed household level need assessment to identify, 500 families to provide with agricultural input (winter) including wheat seeds, fertilizers and basic tools. These families will be provided with ongoing technical support to improve their knowledge and practices to get best yield. The estimated yield will be sufficient to cover the food needs of the household and any excess can be sold in the market to create income generation. The direct recipient of Agriculture support will be 250 men and 250 women. 
550 families (who have existing livestock) will be provided with sheep feed and dry fodder (straw). During the gestation period the sheep will be provided feed. This will be the winter period when the feed is most expensive and unaffordable. The sheep will be vaccinated to prevent them from prevailing diseases. The households will also receive livestock kit to help them in collecting and processing milk. The expected milk production is sufficient to cover the household diary needs and any excess can be sold in the market to contribute to the income. The direct recipient of this component will be 275 men and 275 women. 
The beneficiaries of both component will be connected to the markets by providing all the necessary information about where agricultural and livestock products are sold near to their lands and the current market prices, which help beneficiaries not to travel long distances in addition to linking wheat producers with the beneficiaries of the same project in order to conduct an exchange of products, which contributes to reducing the costs of selling through intermediaries and contributes to the beneficiary&apos;s access to various animal products in the same place in order to obtain various products that meet their requirements. All information is provided through continuous communication with the groups of formed committees through awareness sessions conducted by the Islamic Relief Team.
Both beneficiary groups (livestock and agriculture) will continue to receive follow-up advice and training over the course of the project from field project team hired for this purpose. it is anticipated that this improved knowledge will be shared by the direct beneficiaries with their relatives, PEER and friends living in the close by area. hence the knowledge transfer will help to improve the agriculture-based livelihood practices for the other community members also.
Given the particular sensitivities related to women engaging in project activities a careful weighing of the risks associated with providing such support will be undertaken to ensure that no harm comes to beneficiaries or field staff. The project will seek to prioritize women and those with disabilities by tailoring the support provided, in an effort to better respond to their specific needs and concerns. 
IR staff will organize an awareness session for IR staff and gather Medical face masks, Alcohol sterile, LaTeX gloves, and thermometer for COVID-19 protection.
The project will target both the IDP and host population so that the social tensions among the two groups are minimized and equal opportunities are provided to help the extremely vulnerable families to stand on their own feet and build a culture of resilience. 
IR will implement cluster proposed sector integration strategy whereby the households shifting from food support to agriculture base livelihood are prioritised.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the food security status of assessed food insecure people by providing cash for food and response to winterization needs by providing cash for heating.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is complementary to other SCHF ongoing project (14980), that aimed to provide one-off MPGs to 4375 families to the newly IDPs and most vulnerable HCs in the north of Aleppo, the distribution of MPGs will be finalized by the end of June, and this project will complement what we have started before, the project consists of two main activities in two sectors:
1- Under FSL: GAN will shift the beneficiaries from the emergency to a regular assistance to the most vulnerable families (1000 out of 4375) in two communities: Mar&#x2019;e and Salamah, the geographical areas are prioritized by FSL, GAN conducted 1751 interviews between 8 April to 20 May, 96% of families were unable to secure food according to the answers of the heads of families.
The proposed modality is a cash for food, as it is considered the most effective especially under the context of COVID-19 epidemic, where cash modality requires less staff during the delivery of assistance and reduces touching with the beneficiaries, according to our experience in this modality the beneficiary does not need more than 5 minutes to receive the assistance.
The assistance will be tailored according to the family size to achieve the benefit and the fair distribution of the assistance (12$ per person monthly) as the sector strongly recommended the feeding period of 8 distributions (8 months out of 12 months) to the assessed same food-insecure households.
a monthly market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and accessibility will be conducted to ensure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have a good and equal accessibility to the different goods.
GAN selected the beneficiaries in the ongoing project (14980) with 100% verification based on the vulnerability and eligibility criteria including displacement duration criteria since the newly IDPs are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks, the project also prioritized the women-headed households as well as the households with children, disabilities, pregnant, and lactating women, so GAN will re-visit 100% of beneficiaries to identify the most people in need to target them. 
2- Under SNFI: GAN will respond to life-saving winterization needs for the same beneficiary: according to the 1751 interviewed families About 26% of them live in tents, 37% of them live in unfinished homes or not suitable for living (cellar, warehouse, hangar) and the bad conditions of these families lead to more challenges for them, especially during the winter season as these families use multiple means of heating according to their financial ability, and based on the last PDM results and lesson learned, one type of heating fuel did not achieve the expected benefit, families that live in tents prefer use firewood and/or perrin for heating others prefer diesel, and the targeted areas where (-4) is the lowest registered degree with some coverage of snow in different locations and (4) the average degree in winter, all of these conditions drive families to adopt many negative coping mechanisms, so GAN conclude to provide winterization heating means using e-voucher modality to access all type, the distribution will be conducted in 3 monthly rounds, starting from 1 Nov 2020 to Jan 2021, 2 weeks for redemption and 2 weeks for validation and PDM, 60$ per family will be assigned monthly, 180$ in total during the intervention period, this will enable families to purchase their preferred type of heating means.
Due to the lack of the banking system in northern Syria, GAN will identify the money transfer agents by conducting a competitive process after assessing the markets and the vendors&apos; capacities in the local markets. where the identified vendors will be responsible for delivering the cash amount to the beneficiaries in the different locations and the payment for agent will be conducted after finalizing the distribution of each few days which reduces the security risk in delivering the cash in such complex context.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Food Security and Winter Shelter and Non-Food Item Assistance in Afrin District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed integrated action will address critical Food Security (FS) and winter  Non-Food Item (NFI) needs of 7,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) living in underserved informal settlements in Jandairis and Ma&#x2019;btali sub-districts of Afrin, Aleppo. The draft 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) ranks FS and winterization needs as severe in targeted areas. A mixed modality approach using both in-kind and cash-based assistance will be used to improve food security and increase access to life-saving and life-sustaining  winter NFI needs, specifically heating fuel. The action has been informed by a Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) completed during April 2020 in coordination with other Syrian NGOs to inform an integrated and informed multi-sector response to better address needs. 

Over the ten-month action, eight rounds of repeat in-kind food assistance will be provided to underserved assessed food insecure IDPs in protracted displacement and living in forgotten informal settlements. Food basket composition is aligned with FSL cluster guidance and designed to meet 70% of kilocalorie and nutrient needs per person per day. Food commodities will be procured under an existing Framework Agreement with a tested supplier to ensure timely delivery of FS assistance from the second month of the action. The in-kind approach was informed by the April MSNA in Afrin and Al Bab districts which found a preference for in-kind food assistance and market access challenges for some respondents in camps and informal settlements. The focus on FS aligns with the priorities of this Standard Allocation (SA) and is informed by Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) of Big Heart&#x2019;s 2019/20 winterization program which found food to be the priority, remaining need following receipt of winter cash assistance. 

The complementary one-off cash assistance proposed is budgeted at $120 per household in line with S/NFI cluster guidance (August 2019). This will protect thermal comfort and support household well-being and is based on ensuring access to heating fuel (4 liters per household per day) for the coldest 60 days. Our April 2020 MSNA in Afrin district found markets to be the primary source of NFIs and a strong preference for cash-based assistance to meet NFI needs. Big Heart PDM with winter cash beneficiaries also found a cash-based modality to be appropriate to beneficiary needs, with 79% of respondents in one community expressing satisfaction with the modality (the remaining 21% would have preferred a higher cash transfer). 100% of the sample also stated that assistance was useful and necessary to their needs, and that they were satisfied with the distribution process. Shelter needs of targeted beneficiaries have been assessed. The majority are resident in tents provided by AFAD. Big Heart will coordinate with AFAD and other response actors regarding provision of replacement / upgraded tents for targeted beneficiaries. An integrated approach addressing FS and NFI needs seeks to ensure the winter cash transfer value is protected and used for non-food winter needs. 

The threat of the COVID 19 pandemic has been considered as a cross-cutting theme through-out the design of the action, as detailed under Section 3 (Link with Allocation Strategy).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve Access to Income Generation and Job Opportunities for Host and IDP Communities through an Inter-cropping Agricultural System in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goals of the project are to maximize agricultural production through maximizing land use, improving food diversity, and improving access to additional income for the most affected small and mid-sized olive farmers through Intercropping Agriculture System. Moreover, the project aims to create temporary job opportunities for IDPs in the target locations by involving them in Cash for Work - CFW- for the harvesting of crops planted between olive trees. More specifically, 550 olive farmers will be supported with agricultural inputs seeds, fertilizers pesticides, sufficient to farm three dunums of winter fava bean and two dunums of peas, in addition to support olive trees with Soluble NPK fertilizer for spring fertilization of olive trees and pesticides that will improve olive farm productivity. Also, 917 women of the IDP community, over the age of 18, who displaced since December 1, 2019, will be involved in working for 20 days in CFW for the harvesting of crops planted through Inter-cropping Agricultural System with daily wages of 6 USD. Olive farmers and CFW workers will be selected based on the clear selection criteria mentioned in Annex 2. The allocated support in this project is divided into nine communities in Salqin and Idleb sub-districts, Annex 20, and according to the numbers of small and mid-sized farmers and the number of IDPs in each targeted community. To build sufficient technical capacity and knowledge about the best agricultural practices for inter-cropping techniques, IRD is planning to support the target farmers with two practical training stages through the establishment of farmer field school FFS in the target communities. All planned activities, especially training activities, will be implemented taking into consideration all COVID-19 preventive measures prepared by the ATWG and approved by the FSL Cluster in April 2020. These measures include applying social distancing, distribution of medical gloves and masks, and ensuring that appropriate sterilization and cleaning materials are available for everyone olive farmers, women who will be involved in CFW, vendors, drivers, and project field team to avoid any infection of COVID-19.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting wheat value chain and income generating activities in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to improve the level of sustained food security in northwest Syria through supporting wheat value chain for one hectare for most vulnerable 1500 farmers (85% M, 15% F, 4% PwD, HCs and IDPs), 7500 individuals (1725M,1800F,2250B,1725G) in Sharan, Jandairis, A&#x2019;zaz&#x2019; and Aghtrin.
Targeted locations were identified based on need and market assessments (Annex 7), where assessment shows that ,many farmers moved from wheat planting as a strategic crop towards planting cash crops which provide more income.
Meetings and FGDs with local actors and farmers (males and females) will be held to explain the project goals and take any suggestions and ensure their support.
The project will achieve its objectives through a combination of five interventions:
1. Preparing farmers&#x2019; lands through supporting agriculture machine owners by contracting with them to plow the targeted farmers&#x2019; lands in order to be prepared for planting seeds
2. Providing the farmers with agriculture inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides) through $250 restricted value E-voucher which maintains farmers dignity and gives them flexibility to choose the best inputs for growing wheat from a set of pre-appointed items from multiple vendors who were selected through a committee based on pre-specific criteria.
Vouchers distribution will be in Aug while the loading of balances will be done in 4 phases ($52.5 for phosphate fertilizer,$60 for seeds,$87.5 Urea fertilizer,$50 Pesticides), where balances will only be uploaded after field verification visits verify that the farmer used the received materials.
The project team will follow up the redemption process. After the end of distribution, we will conduct a PDM to measure beneficiaries satisfactory.
3. Providing farmers with theoretical and practical extension training sessions in order to strengthen their knowledge about the best practices for wheat growing which avoid environmental harm, and detecting the wheat deceases, as well as the continuous providing of consultancy services, through a team of expert agronomists, who will conduct two rounds of field visits to farmers locations in addition to following up WhatsApp groups to verify the progress of project and provide the farmers with technical advises.
4. Supporting farmers in marketing their crops through distributing packaging bags to be filled by wheat during harvest, in addition to contacting with organizations working in supporting value chain to ensure better marketing of the supported crops.
5. Supporting vulnerable CFW female workers with temporary income, through hiring 252 women for a month to assist farmers in weeding and Sunn pest management.
Takaful will ensure that the farmers will be positively involving in the project to achieve the objectives, through funding 61% of the total costs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, plowing, Packaging bags), while farmer will fund 39% (fuel for irrigation and harvesting costs).
Protection measures based on FSL cluster recommendation &#x201C;FSL Prevention and Mitigation Measures for COVID-19 on the Implementation of Agricultural Projects&#x201D; will be implemented. 
In case any problems and missing access for any of the targeted areas, we will change the location according to specific criteria in coordination with FSL Cluster, where Takaful conducted need assessment in 4 other locations.
We will ensure that the principle of Do No Harm is applied in all project&apos;s activities through markets visits, distribution monitoring and exit surveys. In addition, we will target group of women and PwD who are in charge of agricultural work, where we will take into account the difficulties of some of them related to accessing the market, where we will verify their needs and deliver items to their homes. 
We will coordinate with FSL cluster, agriculture working group, local communities and NGOs who are working in same locations, in addition to sharing the eligible locations with FSL and ER clusters to avoid any overlap</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting of self-reliance of affected households in rural of Aleppo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project endeavors to implement integrated activities in the humanitarian field in western rural of Aleppo province. This intervention will make contribution towards addressing critical food insecurity, instability and develop the essential household&#x2019;s livelihood assets through supporting the wheat value chain, access to agriculture, livestock breeders, bakeries, and IDPs/returnees. The project includes implementation of the main activities:
1. Supplementing the wheat support chain, as MASRRAT through its ongoing project is supporting 480 wheat farmers beneficiaries in Aleppo countryside, the project is funded by OCHA and will end in the July when the harvest is over, and through this intervention, it is planned to support the wheat chain by purchasing 500 kg of wheat from each beneficiary (based on specific criteria) and will be milled, as flour and bran. So, we will have approximately 80% flour equivalent to 192 tons and about 20% bran equivalent to 48-tons in order to:
A. Support the bakeries by wheat flour to produce 211.2 tons of bread to distribute it for free to 2400 families in camps and returnees for two consecutive months. MASRRAT will contract with four bakeries to increase the community participation and reduce work pressure so they do not exceed the daily production capacity.
B. As for the 48-tons of wheat bran, we will support 240 livestock breeders by distributing of 200 kg of bran for each beneficiary. Beneficiaries of livestock breeders will be the families who have (1-10 livestock) and not supported. In addition, training will be provided to livestock breeders on breeding of animals and products.
2. Improving access to agriculture by distributing of agricultural inputs for 600 beneficiaries. Every beneficiary will receive 250 kg of wheat seeds, 150 kg of composed fertilizer, 200 kg of Azote fertilizer, 1 liter of Herbicide,1 liter of Insecticide, one fuel voucher for irrigation 50 $ and harvesting costs 50 $. Moreover, the support will include provision of three technical training sessions about GAP. The beneficiaries of wheat activity will be from the local community and IDPs who settled for a while, own or renting land between 7 to10 donums suitable for wheat, as well as the farmers who meet the selection criteria. All the agricultural inputs will be purchases inside Syria in order to support the local markets.

This project will support 12951 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (3229 men, 2867 women, 3334 boys and 3521 girls) by promoting their accessibility to the humanitarian assistance significantly. All the people in the targeted villages and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project where the wheat and livestock production will be available in the markets at good prices. Furthermore, this intervention will improve the capacity of 2400 IDPs and returnees (men, women, children pregnant, elderly and disabled) who returned to their areas in Atareb sub-district in Aleppo and don&#x2019;t able to get sufficient quantities of bread because of poverty or inability due to lack of enough bakeries or bread distribution points. The project is designed with consideration to the cluster and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support and conducting trainings. In addition, protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from MASRRAT protection Centers in Aleppo, in the event of any GBV referral cases.

The targeted villages in jabal Samman district - Atareb sub-districrt - are considered from the most densely populated areas: 
- Jeineh village 14.000 HHs and 5.000 IDPs 
- Atareb 50.000 HHs and 6.000 IDPs

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support self-reliance of affected households by restoring and creating income-generating opportunities to sustain lives</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the proposed project is to enhance agricultural production, the food, and income-generating opportunities of affected households and communities in southwest Idlib especially among the most vulnerable households and communities. The proposed intervention focus on i) Improve the marketing of wheat products of farmers and support wheat/bread availability in conflict-affected regions ii) Improve the access of small livestock breeders to animal feeders iii) Restore income-generating assets amp increase agricultural production and improved economic conditions and labor market opportunities in the targeted communities. 

Over 6210 households are to be reached throughout the locations targeted by this project. At least 51% of the direct beneficiaries will be women and 5% of people with disabilities. Indirect beneficiaries are estimated at 110,000. Participation will be open to resident farmers, IDPs, and returnees with the exact ratio outlined in the proposal. 

The intervention logic assumes that agricultural development and investment in an improved value chain, in a strategic area such as wheat, can lead to increased food security, and contribute to more resilient livelihoods while equally addressing factors that compel people to migrate by creating employment opportunities, especially for vulnerable people. It is also assumed to reduce the risk of conflicts over resources and contribute to solutions to environmental degradation and climate change. 

The geographical scope of the project focuses on the southwest Idlib governorate. Indicatively the 9 following locations will be targeted: Mhambal, Shagurit, Northern Laj, Maarat Timsrin, Sarmin, Ainata, Hila, Ora Qabli - Edwan, and Acrobat.

The proposed project is building directly on an ongoing EU funded project implemented by WATAN based on mutually reinforcing effects and efficiency of the interventions along the wheat production cycle (please refer to the complementarity and exit strategy sections). It will also integrate the ongoing SCHF project in the same locations, by providing services to host communities and returnees area that is currently available to IDPs only.

Our intervention will be aligned with the wheat crop calendar and improve the purchasing power of 300 households under (output 1.1). 700 tons of wheat seeds and 600 tons of hay will be purchased 280 tons of wheat will be used as seeds for the next season&#x2019;s planting, after sifting and sterilizing by the established seeds bank. The other 420 tons of purchased wheat will be supplied to the contracted mill to be grinded, and, as a result, 336 tons of flour will be obtained and supplied to the bakery established and supported by WATAN. Consequently, bread for 1920 households can be produced and distributed free of charge (output 1.2). The remaining amount (84 tons) is used as bran to be provided along with 600 tons of hay to 2420 livestock breeders as feeders for their animals (output 2.1).

On the other hand, 1400 farmers will benefit from the distribution of wheat inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, pests control materials and harvesting costs, among which 175 farmers will receive TOT and capacity building on wheat crop integrated management through the establishment of 7 farmer field schools in the targeted areas (output 2.2). 

Moreover, 170 cash-for-work workers will be selected to implement activities related to firefighting and integrated pest management (output 2.3).

All these activities will be implemented in line with the &#x201C;Prevention and mitigation measures for COVID-19 on the implementation of agricultural projects&#x201D; that have been developed by WATAN and FSL cluster&#x2019;s partners (please refer to the risk management section).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response to the Food Security needs of the most vulnerable conflict-affected IDPs through free bread distribution in camps in Aleppo governorate.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BINAA team has conducted a needs assessment in North Aleppo camps (Attachment 01B) in order to identify the most vulnerable camps in order to be supported by free bread distribution on a daily base for 6 months. 
After that, we conducted a second need assessment for bakeries which are closed to the selected locations and identified their capacities to prepare the daily needed amount of bread. (The bakeries need assessment is attached, Attachement 02)
We also conducted 4 focus group discussions (Attachment 03) with the local communities (2 sessions with Women and 2 sessions with men) and explained the project activities, all attendance showed their willingness in the project activities and confirmed their needs for this kind of support. After that we coordinate with the FSL cluster and the other active organization, so we selected 19 camps accordingly which are located in Aghtrin, Al Bab, Ghandorah, and Jarablus subdistricts. (The need assessment report is attached, Attachment 04)
The project aims to support 6,370 HHs (42,076 INDs: 8,704 men, 10,107 Women, 10,476 boys, 12,789 girls) by free bread distribution on average of 3 bread bundles with 600 g per family per day for 180 days. (each person will receive 300 g of bread per day)
We will select the closest bakeries to the targeted camps and supporting them by the sufficient flour and the operational cost in order to produce the needed amounts of bread and provide the identified amount of bread to the targeted camps on a daily base.
The bakeries will provide the bread to the representative in the targeted camps who will distribute the bread to the camp&apos;s population according to the identified beneficiary list. 
BINAA team will monitor the bread preparing into the bakeries and the bread distribution in order to ensure a high-quality service and high-quality production, the quality bread quality control process is attached (Attachment 05)
In the first month, BINAA will sign a MOUs with the local councils and the camps managements. After that, we will prepare the beneficiaries list in collaboration with local councils and the camp management. Then, BINAA team will conduct verification visits to all families in the targeted camps in order to identify the total family number per camp and issue the final beneficiary list, therefore the needed amount of bread per camp.
In the second month, we will release the final list for the beneficiaries, each family will receive the own card, the card will contain the essential information and the daily amount of bread, these cards will be distributed monthly. 
In parallel with the beneficiaries selection process, we will select the Flour provider and the bakeries through procurement tender while we will buy the flour from the local markets, and the bakeries will be selected from the closest locations to the targeted camps in order to ensure receiving a fresh bread by the targeted beneficiaries as well as BINAA will hire an observer in both bakeries and camps to ensure a high-quality product, high quality of transportation and equitable and safe distribution process.
BINAA will take the COVID-19 precautions in all project phases starting from beneficiary selection till the bread distribution according to BNAA COVID-19 Guidance (The BINAA COVID-19 guidance id attached, Attachment 19)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase the Resilience of Olive Farmers and Improve the Livelihoods Opportunities for the Conflict-affected Populations in Idleb Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to build community capacity to contribute to and benefit from this new economy, which will increase resilience of people in NWS to ongoing shocks of conflict, displacement, or the medium-term economic uncertainty. The project focuses on critical analysis of Olive Value Chain (OVC), supports livelihoods by increasing households&apos; ability to meet the needs, and encourages self-reliance. 

The project will be based in Maaret Tamsrin sub-district (Maaret Tamsrin, Haranbush, Kafr Jales, Kafr Nabi), Harim sub-district (Harim, Besnaya), and Kafr Takharim sub-district (Kafr Takharim). The project will achieve its aspired objective by supporting (OVC), in line with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines, through following package of activities:

1) 1,600 male and female olive farmers (owning between 1 to 4 dunums of land each) will receive agricultural inputs and services, extension sessions, olive harvesting and water harvesting support based on their olive orchards size to contribute to decreasing the cost of production the package of support will be:

   a. Distribution of cash voucher (25$/dunum) to support the olive farmers the voucher will cover the cost of pest management, pressing, packaging, and transportation. Approx. 4,800 dunums will be covered - on average 3 dunums per farmer.
   b. Provision of pruning tools including a hand saw, a small ax, and scissors for all selected farmers.
   c. Supporting targeted farmers with weeding amp water harvesting around olive trees and olive harvesting services through two rounds of CFW (refer to component #3).
   d. Distribution of GAP booklets to farmers

2) 40 focal points/group leaders from farmers (10% female) will receive four extension sessions about GAP and presentation skills, and will transfer the knowledge and strengthen the capacity of at least 1000 olive farmers from above target (1600 farmers). Each group leader will deliver sessions to 25 farmers. The group leaders will receive stipends - 5$ per session - to cover their transportation and launch. 

3) 2300 workers/HHs will benefit from temporary income-generating activities through CFW activities for one round of 20 days. Workers will be divided into 2 groups: the 1st group (550 workers: 500 unskilled and 50 skilled) will be for weeding and water harvesting and the 2nd (1750 workers: 1600 unskilled and 150 skilled) for olive harvesting. Approx. 60% are female, 40% are IDPs, 5% PwD and chronic illnesses. 

4) 90 participants/HHs (50% women) will benefit from small business grants the beneficiaries will be trained through six sessions about business skills. After reviewing the submitted business plans from 100 participants, selected beneficiaries (90) who meet the eligibility criteria will receive 300$ to start/restart their businesses related to the olive value chain. The business can include but not limited to food processing and olive by-products (soap and coal). The beneficiaries can submit individual or group business plans.

5) 42 technicians will benefit from a 3-month technical training program through CFW and Cash for Training (CFT) modalities as follows:
 - 30 unskilled trainees (new or undergraduate agronomists and technicians) will receive training about olive pruning, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and GAP the trainees will be paid unskilled-worker wages (6$ daily) over three rounds (60 days) and
 - 12 skilled agriculture experts/trainers (agro pharmacies owners and expert agronomists) will deliver the theoretical and practical training for the above 30 unskilled trainees for a period of three months (60 training days) including field days, site visits, coaching in agro-pharmacies. The trainers will be paid skilled-worker wages (7$ daily).

Also, distribution of soap (for COVID-19 prevention) will be conducted for the farmers and CFW workers (4 pieces per person).

In total, the project will target 4072 unique HHs, 20360 individuals: M 4479, W 4886, B 5701,G 5294</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-sectoral emergency assistance for vulnerable people in Euphrates Shield Area and Afrin</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is linked to the OPS project HSYR20-FSCSHLWSH. WHH intends to deliver immediate support to people in need in the Euphrates Shield area and Afrin. The proposed intervention has three components: (1) distribution of multi-sectoral (FSL-WASH-SNFI) vouchers to internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in camps and unconditional cash assistance to the most vulnerable (2) Cash for Work (CfW) activities to enhance the hygiene in camps and (3) COVID-19 awareness campaigns in the camps.The first component of the project aims at covering the basic needs of IDPs in camps in the areas of food security, NFI and hygiene through multi-sectoral vouchers, unconditional cash assistance and CfW activities. 
Vouchers: 
Beneficiaries will be able to redeem the food, nonfood and hygiene items from a list based on nutritional dietary and basic personal hygiene needs. The voucher value will be 120$ per  HH per month and each HH will receive it for eight months. The activity will take place in two locations, one in Afrin and one in Azaz, and in each one 487 HHs will be targeted. In total, 975 HHs will benefit from the activity. The distribution will take place in IDP camps through blanket distribution. Vendors will be selected based on the proximity to the settlements and their supply capacity as well as the quality and price of items. 
Cash for Work: 
Regarding CfW activities 300 people will be selected to work for 96 days each with a salary of 1.9 USD per day. The main purpose of this activity is to increase the financial liquidity of the most vulnerable camp population to enable them to meet their basic food needs and to enhance the hygiene in camps by cleaning the streets, irrigation systems and open channels. Furthermore, 30 of the most  vulnerable disabled people and widows who don&#x2019;t have a person at home to work will be selected to receive the assistance unconditionally. 
To complement this, the third component aims at increasing COVID-19/hygiene awareness in the IDP camps. Taking into account women empowerment, female camp members will be selected from the same camps and trained as hygiene mobilizers and develop a hygiene awareness campaign plan in the TOT. The TOT will also cover protection issues, allowing the mobilizers to recognize protection cases and act on them. This activity will also take place in two cycles in each one 20 women will be identified and trained followed by the implementation of the hygiene awareness campaign plan over a period of three months. It is targeted at women specifically, as they are mostly the ones who take care of the children and the hygiene and sanitation of the settlement places. Also considering female hygiene needs, women are more vulnerable. In a second step, the hygiene mobilizers will be sharing the information they learnt in the training by implementing the awareness campaign, which will include household visits inside their camps. Lastly, they will reflect on their experiences and gather lessons learnt in a report. They will also have the chance to reflect on their experiences and discuss lessons learnt in a one-day-session with the trainer of the TOT in a follow-up session after performing the HH visits. The hygiene mobilizers will receive incentives for their work.
By training and engaging female hygiene mobilizers from among the target population WHH supports further engagement and participation of women in the humanitarian response. In order to create a combination where people in need will be able to redeem hygiene items through the vouchers and learn practical knowledge on hygiene, both components address the same target group. The selection of camps will be based on humanitarian principles, where the most vulnerable camps will be targeted based on the less access they have to food, nonfood and hygiene items. The project will be implemented inside IDP camps since the people living there had to leave their belongings behind, which puts them into a more vulnerable position</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Provision of Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Healthcare Services for the Conflict Affected Population in Need Within Harim District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the SCHF 2020 SA1 allocation- health cluster objectives, and in response to the demonstrated needs and gaps in health service provision for the conflict- affected population within Harim district, Human Appeal (HA) proposes to support the functionality of three healthcare facilities in the district for a duration of 9 months, namely:
	&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; maternity hospital in Sarmada/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703086): Supported from HA direct fund since November 2019.
	Human Appeal Mobile Clinic in Sarmada IDPs camps/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: B0200196): Operated by HA since November 2019 through funding provided by a partner external to OCHA. However, the fund will end by the 31st of May 2020.
	&#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; IDP camp primary healthcare PHC center in Little Hir Jamus/ Salqin sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703016): Lacking support since the 10th of January 2020 and has since been operated on voluntarily basis by its staff in coordination with IHD.

The above facilities will be providing primary and secondary healthcare services for people in need within their individual catchment areas as follows:
	RH outpatient consultations (All three facilities).
	Pediatric outpatient consultations (All three facilities).
	General medicine outpatient consultations (HA MC and &#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D;).
	Community health awareness services (All three facilities).
	Provision of essential medicines (All three facilities).
	Referral capacity (&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital and HA MC only).
	CEmONC services, laboratory services, inpatient healthcare for the women of reproductive age and newborns (&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital only).
	MHPSS and basic trauma care services (&#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; PHC center).

Besides referring to the health cluster/ Turkey hub dashboard health facilities map, and for the purpose of ensuring coordinated and non-duplicating intervention, HA, during the design phase, was very keen to coordinate and communicate with the partners and coordination bodies relevant to project including Idleb health directorate, SRH TWG, and Sham foundation as being operating a pediatric specialized hospital in Sarmada, the same community where &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital is based (Communication are attached). 

In addition to the above service package, and to ensure integration of COVID-19 related preparedness and response measure, HA proposes to establish and operate COVID-19 triage stations at the entry of both &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital and &#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; PHC center for a duration of 3 months during the overall project implementation period depending on the situation on the ground, particularly confirming any case of COVID-19 in NW- Syria (However, this component is subject to modification if needed as per the feedback by the relevant reviewing individuals/ committees from the health cluster and OCHA ends in case this application qualifies for further reviews). 

In order to support directing the use of the allocation- matched funds for the purpose of directly serving the targeted population, It&#x2019;s imperative to mention that HA will provide co-funding of around 175,000 USD planned to support the provision of all medicines, medical and lab supplies required at all three facilities, rehabilitation costs of &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital, and provision of the majority of project support staff remuneration costs needed for ensuring the smooth implementation of the proposed activities and provision of the planned healthcare services.

With the above details alongside the planned indicator targets, beneficiaries to be reached and the consideration of the total costs proposed to be matched to this allocation, the cost per medical procedure matched to this application will be less than 7 USD and considering HA co-fund, it will be around 8.5 USD, where both values are considered to be highly efficient against the average cost of around 10-12 USD across NW- Syria.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Alamal hospital - orthopedic surgical hospital</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria is soon entering its ninth year of violent and devastating conflict, with the situation in the Northern provinces dramatically worsening and hospitals frequently becoming targets of attacks. Moreover, with several hundred thousand people reportedly displaced and one of the largest influxes of IDPs reported in the region, the situation is becoming increasingly acute as health facilities are greatly overstrained and medical resources are missing. A potential COVID19 outbreak would have to accelerate devastating effects and further amplify the dire needs in the health sector while putting a great risk on the continuation of essential interventions. As of now, secondary healthcare services fall over 60% short of the benchmark (for a more detailed account see the needs assessment section).

This project aims to provide lifesaving and limb-saving health care services to more than 150,000 individuals (indirect beneficiaries). This will be done through the provision of out-patient clinics, an emergency department, and surgical operating rooms at Alamal Hospital. This project will complete the infrastructure of the hospital facilities, contracting the medical staff, and offering both diagnostic and therapeutic supplies, to fill the gap in secondary health care in the area of orthopedics, and offer a specialized center with an on-call vascular surgeon. This will ultimately result in a decreasing rate of amputation and the complication of trauma. Aligned to the first objective of the health cluster for 2020 of ensuring the continuity of essential healthcare services, especially during the COVID19 pandemic, this project is addressing this objective with orthopedic treatments being identified as a greatly needed essential healthcare service and is also in line with the priority workshop result in early 2020 which a decision to focus on investing in the development of existing health facility than creating new ones. In the face of a potential outbreak of COVID-19, orthopedic patients will have even harder access to the dignified treatment needed and with their conditions gradually deteriorating, this will have severe negative future consequences in terms of hospital facilities and medical equipment but also in terms of the affected peoples&#x2019; self-reliance, resilience, and economic participation. The affected groups risk being further pushed into vulnerability and marginalization. 

This overall objective of this project is to support &#x201C;Al Amal Hospital&#x201D; to improve the accessibility of essential orthopedic and trauma specialized health services in Salqin sub-district for both IDPs and the host community. The specific objectives of the project are to:
(1) Decrease the morbidity and mortality among the trauma and orthopedic cases in the sub-district of Salqin
(2) Maintain the hospital services available during the COVID19 pandemic and ensure filling the gap in the area.
(3) Strengthen the infrastructure of the facility to include the essential equipment and supplies.
(4) Building the technical capacity of health workers. 

About 23,285 direct and 150,000 indirect beneficiaries are targeted by the intervention, whereby at least 40% of direct beneficiaries will be women, 7% will be people with disabilities. he geographical scope of the project will be Salqin- Harim- Idlib where more than 300K individuals are currently residing. 

The intervention logic assumes that improving the accessibility to life-saving and life-sustaining secondary healthcare and the capacity and infrastructure of hospitals in the field of orthopedic and trauma in Salqin sub-district will contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity rates and contribute to communities living self-reliant and dignified lives, while sustainably freeing up limited hospital and health care capacities in the long run. 

Name of the facility:

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support IDA blood bank and Thalassemia center as well as the internal department of Wasim Maaz Hospital in Azaz, Aleppo governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The resilience of local communities and the health system in northwest Syria has weakened considerably during the last few months with the relentless military offensive by the Government of Syria and its allies, which began in December 2019. This has forcibly displaced around 1 million people towards the closed Turkish border in the north, with gt68 health facilities attacked between April 2019 and February 2020 according to recent research (attached with title COVID 19 response in northwest Syria). The project aims at supporting IDA blood bank and Thalassemia center B0204072 as well as the internal department of Wasim Maaz Hospital in Aleppo governorate, Azaz district, Azaz sub-district, Azaz community C1654 (HeRAMS code: !B0204006). The blood bank in Azaz supports 10 health facilities in the area with blood bags. The Sphere Standards for Blood Collection and Laboratory Practice for Blood and Blood Products will be taken into account and complied with during the implementation of the activities. Three testing procedures will be used to ensure the safety of the blood collected. The maximum storage period (33 days) is continuously monitored, infected, or expired blood is disposed of in existing incinerators and medical waste disposal pits. A loss of 12% of the blood donated can be expected, which must be classified as unsafe and destroyed. A total of 4 blood products will be generated: Erythrocyte concentrate, blood serum, platelets, and whole blood. In Azaz district and surrounding areas, there are 
The two facilities are ongoing and active and play a key role in supporting IDPs in camps and the Host community population in the whole area of northern Aleppo. 
Azaz area, where the two proposed facilities are located, are considered safe areas which make them a resort for the newly displaced people. Thus, supporting the proposed facilities will be a response to the acute health needs in the areas.
The internal department in the hospital will be supported, both inpatient and outpatient wards. Through this project, medical consultations in general medicine, endocrinology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and hematology, as well as medicine distribution and referral services from Syria to Turkey and within Syria, will be delivered to people in need, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, including elderly persons, reproductive-aged women, and chronically-ill patients.
To better respond to COVID-19 and for waste management and disposal, IDA has developed a list of items that were procured for most of IDA health facilities. IDA follows specific guidelines for waste management and disposal.
In fact, the blood bank of Azaz is an existing facility that was supported by a donor and the grant has ended. IDA had been reporting to the health cluster on the Blood Bank of A&apos;zaz. To improve the quality of delivered services, and due to the damage of some devices, IDA identified a set of devices and consumables to be procured under this grant if it was approved. procuring some of these items, not all of them, will jeopardize the quality of delivered services. IDA has developed a COVID-19 response plan of IDA that will be implemented across IDA health facilities in northern Syria. The response plan was derived from WHO taskforce response plan with similar objectives. IDA has already communicated with several partners and donors to fund the COVID-19 preparedness and response plan of IDA. The target facilities in this project are already covered by the necessary equipment and materials for COVID-19 PRP. IDA PRP for COVID-19 was shared with the health cluster previously.
According to the recent estimations from northern Aleppo, the number of registered Thalassemia patients was 108 in March 2020 who will be target by this project</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Quality Secondary and Reproductive Health Care Services in NWS.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SEMA, under the direct support of SCHF, seeks to maintain the introduction of health services, and to continue the essential life-saving interventions including: critical inpatient therapies, reproductive health services, in addition to maintain the availability of essential medication and supplies.
To reach this end, SEMA proposes to support Jisr Ash-Shugur and Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital, in Jisr Ash-Shugur and Dana sub-districts, and thus ensuring the provision of secondary, and reproductive health care to people in need, as the two hospitals are located in under-served areas, whose people are suffering from the lack of medical services and are having difficult living conditions.
SEMA tries to respond to the critical needs of newly displaced population and to address the most urgent gaps by supporting Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital for 12 months and thus ensure the availability of its services, in addition to support Jisr Ash-Shugur hospital for five months.
Jisr- alshoghour hospital:(HeRAMS code: G0704013):
A trauma and surgical hospital, serving a population of 70k in Jisr Ash-Shugur city and surrounding areas including the most vulnerable groups (IDPs, women, children and the elderly) will have access to the following services: OPD (General, Orthopedic), IPD, surgeries, emergency, surgical ward, lab, X-Ray, pharmacy, as the hospital contains 20 beds and two operation theaters.
This hospital was supported by WHO till 15th of March 2020 through SEMA, and currently out of support, it was supposed to be supported by other partner at the beginning of April, but this partner apologized due to funding, and it is now a priority (according to IHD).
Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital:(CEmONC) (HeRAMS code:G0703071):
It is a maternity and childhood hospital in Atmeh (Harim District), and considered as the most major facility in the area, which is crowded with IDPs (total population of 250k IDPs in Atmeh). The hospital has been supported by SEMA through several grant&apos;s since 5 years, and will be out of funding after 20th of June 2020.
Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital includes the following departments:
pediatric and neonatal Department: Provides pediatric consultations and neonatal health care services and equipped with operating new-born incubators. 
Inpatient Department: Where major and minor surgeries are implemented, in addition to the hospitalization of patients. 
ER Department: Where all trauma cases are received and provided with emergency services, then referred to the needed specialty. 
Laboratory: The hospital contains a well-equipped lab to perform the needed tests for the beneficiaries in the hospital. 
X-Ray Department: The hospital contains a well-equipped x-ray department with a variety of different services.
It is worth-mentioning that waste management and disposal in Al-Ikha&apos;a hospital is applied by collecting the medical waste and transporting it for about 50 K from Atma to the incinerator in Idleb. This process is occurred ten times per month where this grant will secure the cost of transportation.
Both hospitals are critical and crucial to their areas, and SEMA has coordinated with IHD to prioritize them for any coming opportunity to support.
Due to the very volatile environment and the development of novel COVID-19, SEMA managed to be flexible in responding to the immediate and urgent needs on the ground, so a dynamic and strong risk management strategy and plan &quot;B&quot; is already set up based on the security developments in the area where activating mobile clinics to reach the elderly and vulnerable cases (people with chronic diseases), in addition to tele-medicine component where some consultations related to COVID-19 and others may be introduced via phone to avoid gatherings.
Moreover, As SEMA always tries to acheive long-term impact and to leave the community in much-stronger case, so the project team will conduct training for the two hospital staff about: BLS, ATLS, resuscitation of new born, COVID19 detection and referral pathway.</narrative>

The project will create 156 income-generating jobs for 159 most vulnerable HHs (125 males, 34 females) in the targeted camps through CFW activities which will improve the infrastructure and environment in the targeted camps. Workers will pave the pathways around the tents (21770 m2) with the stone that will be broken and shaped in nearby lands to the targeted camps, this will improve the lands which stones are taken from as it will reform the lands and make it more suitable for agricultural activities, and will strengthen the social integration between the host community&quot; landlords of surrounded lands&quot; and IDPs. Paving the pathways will improve the winterization conditions for IDPs in the targeted camps as it will allow them to walk in dry pathways, not in muddy ones, and mitigate the effects of the floods, especially that BINAA is currently establishing a rainwater drainage system in the targeted camps.
BINAA will establish two sewing workshops in the two camps in (Harbanoush, and Kafr bni), the workshop tents and sewing equipment will be provided by BINAA as they were funded by previous projects. The two workshops will include 7 sewing machines, 2 thread sewing machines, and wooden tables for cutting fabric in addition to small tools needed for sewing, and some fabric needed for sewing. The operational capacity for the two workshops is 10 in Kafr Bini and 7 in Harbanoush per shift (34 women in total). The 34 beneficiary women will be selected among the most vulnerable households in the targeted communities who will be moving to the two camps and have the ability to work and the required commitment. The selection process will be through open selection and application process. The beneficiaries will be trained on best practices for production while building their capacity, they will benefit from cash for work activities for5 months along the project period. 
BINAA and through their experienced team will handle workshops operation and beneficiaries work, in addition to purchasing primary items and then selling the produced items in contractual me methodology as per BINAA policies. For this purpose, a committee will be formed to handle workshop operations, all sewing machines and equipment ownership will go to the beneficiaries themselves at the end of the project in a contractual manner which protects their rights under camp management supervision.  
Furthermore, the project will provide life-saving services for IDP sites HHs which will be moved to the mentioned camps through provision of heating fuel and stoves during the winter season to 1,555 conflict affected IDPs HHs (7,775 individuals) (1788 women, 1555 men, 2333 girls and 2099 boys).
Each family will receive 320 liters of fuel packed in jerry cans, in addition to stove, specification is attached to the proposal.
The fuel will be distributed in 3 batches, starting in November 2020, and ending in January 2021.The distribution will be in kind, the protection measures related to the COVID will be followed in addition to gender considerations during the distribution process, please see attachment 19 (COVID Binaa guidance).

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The scale, severity and complexity of the humanitarian situation and needs in North West Syria (NWS), exacerbated by continuous inter-factional fighting, lawlessness and government military offensives over the past 9 years, have caused an unprecedented number of civilian deaths and largescale population displacement. As of 5 March 2020, when the Russia-Turkey ceasefire was announced, Idleb has seen relative calm, however, the looming threat of a COVID-19 outbreak and renewed fighting remains. 

Since 1 December 2019, almost 1 million people have been displaced from the southern parts of Idleb and Western Aleppo. This raised the total number of displaced people in NWS to 2.84 million (CCCM Snapshot update of 8 March 2020 and Population Overview of NWS of 6 March 2020.). The hostilities impact heavily on civilians who have already endured multiple displacements and years of violence. This has further strained host communities in terms of non-food items (NFIs), winter needs, food, shelter, and protection needs. The winter months signify increased seasonal needs among the most vulnerable. 

GOAL has extensive experience in cross-border humanitarian operations in NWS, including through its well established and agile rapid response mechanism the North Syria Response Facility (NSRF), through which in-kind and cash assistance contributed by a range of institutional donors is pre-positioned, enabling GOAL to provide a rapid, appropriate and needs-based multi-modality response to shocks such as displacement. GOAL&#x2019;s winter response is also delivered through the NSRF.

GOAL is proposing an action to provide life-saving and life-sustaining shelter and NFI support across three sub-districts in Idleb and North Aleppo governorates - A&#x2019;zaz, Qourqeena, Salqin. The selected locations have been coordinated, agreed and confirmed with the SNFI cluster.

Provision of core and essential NFIs
Using the NSRF, GOAL proposes an action of emergency MPCA distribution to cover the needs of affected displaced households (HHs) to purchase core and essential NFIs. Each HH will receive $100 in line with NFI monetization guidance developed by the Shelter and Non-Food Item (SNFI) Cluster and Cash Working Group (CWG). 1,000 HHs/5,000 individuals will benefit from provision of MPCA to cover core and essential NFIs

Provision of seasonal and supplementary NFIs including heating fuel
Under the winterization component, GOAL aims to provide additional support to its vulnerable food security beneficiaries to meet increased needs during the cold winter months using a cash-based response, thus reducing reliance on negative coping strategies. Under this component, 3,600 HHs/18,000 individuals will benefit from provision of $120 of MPCA to cover seasonal and supplementary NFIs including heating fuel. The cash transfer value is decided based on GOAL&#x2019;s experience in winter response and coordination between the SNFI Cluster and the CWG, with SNFI Cluster guidance indicating that $120 will be enough to cover approximately 60 of the coldest days of heating fuel needs with 4 litres per HH/day. GOAL will aim to complete the winter response by the end of December 2020.

As in last year&#x2019;s winter response, GOAL will coordinate beneficiary selection criteria with the SNFI Cluster and the CWG and will include HHs headed by women, minors, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and HHs in mountainous areas with high snow coverage, extreme temperatures, or high winter needs.

The proposed subdistricts for the winter response have been selected based on high levels of need, gaps in NFI response, SNFI Cluster priorities, and GOAL&#x2019;s access. GOAL will coordinate the specific sub-district(s) where the response will take place once the SNFI Cluster coordination team shares the priority locations for 2020 winter responses. GOAL has access to all of the above-mentioned subdistricts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance shelter conditions for the most vulnerable groups of IDPs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is oriented to serve the most vulnerable groups from those were forced to flee out of their places in southern Idlib and western Aleppo governorates between December 2019 and March 2020.

Tracking the last waves of IDPs, most of them have managed to find a safer place away from the front lines. Part of them is living now either in unfinished/partially damaged, or inadequate collective centres which lack the basics needs of daily living standards, such as privacy, dignity, and minimum health requirements.

This project is planned to improve the shelter conditions of the displaced people to improve their living standards and ensure that the provided assistance will be free for all the targeted beneficiaries for one year of safe and dignified conditions, and the activities will include:

1- Provide rehabilitation services for 1,500 IDP households living in 34 collective centres without any appropriate living conditions. (Afrin - Al-Bab - Azaz - Idleb - Dana - Maaret Tamsrin - Sarmada - Armanaz - Salqin - Azmarin)
&quot;Rehabilitation works will include a portion assigned for maintaining and improving the current sanitation facilities of the targeted collective centres&quot;.
2- Provide NFI/CRI kits to 1,500 vulnerable households who are covered within the previous rehabilitation services. (secured fund from WATAN complementary project)
3- Provide complementary winterization assistance including Stoves, and Heating materials from WATAN secure funded activities.
4- Provide awareness support (Banners - Posters - Painted Illustrations on the public facilities) on COVID19 awareness, fire risks, safety, security and PSAE awareness.

&quot;Prior to any technical works or verification process, WATAN team will identify the needs of the collective centres and share it back with Shelter/NFI cluster for the final approval or revision, and then go forward if approved or reallocate with other vulnerable locations inline with cluster strategies and recommendations&quot;.

As for the beneficiaries, WATAN already conducted a need assessment and a 100% verification including a specific scoring system that can identify the targeted groups of this project, meanwhile, the provided support will keep seeking to support the shelter capacity and to seek longer-term solutions that can be provided to the affected groups by reallocation households from the camps to the rehabilitated collective centres as well.

The technical needs will be assessed through specialist teams consists of engineers and technicians, and based on their findings, the fund will be allocated to fill the gaps of lacking the basic needs. Bill of quantities will be prepared accordingly, and the implementation will go through contractual services after a tight bidding process.

By these mentioned activities, the provision of longer-term shelter and NFI support in the collective centres will support a better preparedness to the upcoming winter response as well as strengthening the elements of preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Prioritize the most affected communities and coordinate with the active humanitarian actors to secure the basic services to the most vulnerable people, this intervention is designed to meet the needs of women, girls, people with disabilities and elders, with an adequate lifesaving life-sustaining services.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing secure shelter for the most vulnerable people through houses rehabilitation in Afrin, Jandairis, and Mare communities and construction of infrastructure in Mukaveme camp.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&#x2019;s proposed interventions seek to improve the humanitarian situation for the affected population in Northern Aleppo by implementing light and medium rehabilitation of 1,000 houses (Afrin, Mare, and Jandairis communities), besides,Mukaveme camp extension in Shmarekh community which will provide adequate shelter for 300 HHs.
6,500 BNFs will benefit directly from all the shelter interventions.

 1,000 houses are rehabilitated with light/medium rehabilitation activities (600 light $350.00 AVG / 400 medium $800.00 AVG):
Afrin (200 HHs), as a continuation to the ongoing SCHF project where IRD has received more than 1000 requests for rehabilitation but the project target was only 550, Mare (500 HHs), and Jandairis (300 HHs)
30,400 m2 construction of infrastructure (Graveling) in Mukaveme Camp, Shmarekh, to accommodate 300 HHs

The houses rehabilitation activities will mainly focus on:

- Ensuring internal living spaces&#x2019; security and privacy by providing closed, sealed and independent environments for the HH
- Ensuring the maximum beneficiaries&apos; safety
- Ensuring a healthier environment by promoting hygiene and maintaining the WASH facilities in the houses
- Providing illumination and a light power source in each room
- Ensuring better living conditions for people with special needs
IRD will target both IDP and HC households in the rehabilitation activities (IDP 70% HC 30%), those who live in inadequate shelter, especially where minimum SPHERE standards are not met (3.5m2/individual)

As the cluster rehabilitation guidelines for houses with light level of damage (Grade 1), IRD will not interfere with any action that might change the house&#x2019;s specifications and the house&#x2019;s budget will not exceed $400 with no constructional works. Regarding houses with medium level of damage (Grade 2), IRD will do the needed repairs as long as the house is not putting the occupants under danger and HLP standards are met

IRD will sign a coordination document with the BNFs to ensure their right to stay inhabitant in the shelter for at least one year after the date of the rehabilitation work completion.
All BNFs&#x2019; approvals on the terms of assistance are mandatory and the MoU with the LCs will be signed accordingly
Mukaveme Camp infrastructure construction activity will focus on:
- Removing obstacles and leveling the land
- Strengthen the land with backfilling materials
- Graveling the site, to leave the site in the best shape possible for the housing units&#x2019; construction by IHH, taking in consideration minimum sphere amp SNFI cluster standards
- IRD coordinated with IHH and AFAD to implement the construction of infrastructure activity in Mukaveme camp extension after completing the first extension in March 2020, ANNEX 25.
All other required activities are going to be conducted by IHH or its partners in coordination with AFAD, such as the latrines construction, sanitation, drainage, and water systems, electricity system, NFI distributions, fencing etc.

Coordination at all levels and with all stakeholders will be continuous throughout the project duration, and the implementation will be monitored and eventually evaluated to ensure the best application of the implementation methods and to gradually improve work quality. Implementation Plan ANNEX 01.
All activities will be implemented taking in consideration the SNFI cluster&#x2019;s recommendations for COVID-19, especially in: registration points, dealing with BNFs, contractors, workers and IRD staff (physical distancing, sanitizers, masks and gloves, replacing pens, raising awareness banners in a visible place and a suitable hand-washing point at each site)
IRD coordinated with each of Bonyan, Binaa, and SDI as they declared their intention to apply for shelter activity for the same allocation, there was no overlapping either in activities or locations
Coordination emails are in ANNEX 26-27-28.
IRD identified Suran sub-district as the relocation plan&apos;s target if needed</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving emergency and winter support through Cash and GIK distribution for the newly displaced and returnees in NWS.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">the project at hand aims to contribute to the emergency amp winter response by applying a flexible approach that allows Violet to cover the needs in a timely manner and appropriate modality. it aims to help the most vulnerable coping with the displacement amp harsh winter conditions through implementing the following activities
1. &#x650;&#x650;Addressing the needs of 3166 HHs for essential NFIs by the distribution of new arrival kits and/or cash for NFIs (120$). the new arrival kit was designed based on the SNFI cluster guidance and cash amount was designed based on the SMEB

2. provision One-off winter cash (180$) provision for 3000 HHs. The winterization cash amount was designed based on the SNFI cluster guidance but also based on the lessons learned from previous projects to cover heating fuel needs of 5-members HH (4 liters of fuel/day) for 60 days in the winter.  while designing the cash amount, Violet took considered the fuel price differences between winter and summer ( according to REACH,  average fuel price in the last winter was 0.75 USD, while the average price in summer is 0.45 USD). The cash value was discussed with CWG and SNFI. However, Violet will adopt the SNFI and CWG recommendations in case of any change. winterization cash will also contribute to mitigating the risk of storing fuel for a long time by BNF. Additionally, based on the WASH cluster recommendations, each BNF HH will receive 750 g of soap sufficient for 1 month to contribute to COVID-19 response

Cash modality was selected to allow BNFs to secure their needs in a dignified and flexible way. Moreover, it contributes to market recovery through disposing of cash in the market and may create new job opportunities
the project will focus on the newly IDPs in the areas that have been identified with the highest needs, and hosting newly IDPs who fled their homes as a result of GOS offensive, but also the returnees and IDPs who returned to their original communities, or communities of displacement. moreover, winter cash support will be implemented in the areas with a high percentage of damaged shelters like Sarmin, Ariha amp Atareb (According to HNAP report for April 2020) since the IDPs and returnees who living in damaged buildings are the most vulnerable and not protected against the harsh winter conditions.
both groups will be targeted as they are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks. BNFs will be nominated by the community representatives based on the selection criteria including displacement and returning duration taking into account prioritizing women-headed HHs, HHs with children, elderlies, PWD, pregnant, and lactating women
Violet will ensure close coordination with the other actors and SNFI/ CCCM clusters to ensure the coordinated response and to avoid potential overlapping. it also confirms its readiness to immediately start the implementation as soon as the SGA is signed since it is in the final stage of contracting with the new arrival kits supplier, and also has FWA for MTA services and transportation, which will be utilized under this project. The contractors and MTA have been identified through competitive bidding process based on their experience, accessibility, and financial offer.
While the NFI kits and cash coupons will be distributed by Violet teams, the MTA will be responsible for redeeming the BNFs coupons. Before cash distribution, RNA, and market assessment in terms of availability of the NFIs, their prices, and the accessibility will be conducted to ensure the markets are functioning and all BNFs have good and equal access markets. 
In order to ensure the selection criteria are respected and to avoid terrorism financing, fraud, and Forgery, cash coupons will be equipped with light thermal stickers. Moreover,  the verification and antiterrorism check (ATC) will be conducted for all cash BNFs
Finally, Violet will ensure the COVID-19 preventive measures, accountability and SEA mitigation measures are applied.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Living Conditions of the Conflict-affected Population in Northwest Syria through NFI and Winterization Assistance.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to respond to the needs of conflict-affected IDPs and the most vulnerable people of the host community (70% IDPs and 30% host community) in Idleb and Afrin districts, by providing life-saving NFI and winterization assistance through the following components: 

a) providing vulnerable 1000 households (5000 individuals approx.) in Afrin and Janderes sub-districts with in-kind essential Non-Food Item kits that will include the following materials chosen based on the S/NFI Cluster guidance: plastic sheets, jerry cans, solar lamps, sleeping mats, blankets, and hasira/carpet. The procurement of the NFI kits will be done in Turkey, and this will avoid impacting the local markets and any potential increase of local prices. This component will mainly target IDPs who have not received any similar assistance during the last displacement. This component will be implemented during the first three months of the project (distribution, including procurement, to take place in July-September period). 

b) distribution of restricted vouchers for heating fuel needed during the winter season in 2020 in Afrin, and Janderes in Aleppo governorate and Kafr Takharim, Armanaz and Maaret Tmisreen in Idleb. Winterization activity will target 2800 HHs (14,000 individuals) of both IDPs (70%) and HCs (30%) with 2 restricted vouchers for two rounds during winter months (December 2020 and January 2021) total value of the vouchers will be 120 USD (two vouchers: each with 60 USD value). This was determined based on the SNFI winter guidance and coordination with and preference of the SNFI Cluster, where the average need per household in NWS is 4 L of fuel daily, or 10 kg of coal per day for continuous 60 days minimum. This will ensure reaching more beneficiaries during the harsh winter season. Shafak will conduct an assessment in the targeted locations to identify the type of stoves the targeted beneficiaries are using to determine the suitable type of heating fuel (diesel, or charcoal), and contract with suppliers accordingly. As for voucher printing, it will be procured from Turkey, and transferred to Syria (transfer of goods to the final delivery point, Shafak office in Bab Al-Hawa, will be a condition in the contracts with the printing vendors, who use commercials border crossings - Shafak already has experience in such procurement). The modality of restricted vouchers has been chosen to ensure that targeted beneficiaries will use the vouchers only for intended assistance (fuel/charcoal for heating). 

c) Distribution of soap bars (six pieces - 125g each) to enhance beneficiaries&apos; prevention against COVID-19 these items will be distributed along with each of the above components.

In total, this project intends to reach 3800 households (19000 individuals:  4,470 men,  4,886 women,  4,470 boys, 5,175 girls) focusing on IDP sites such as unfinished buildings, collective centers and informal settlements. Shafak selected these communities based on the following: a) IDPs movement tracking, b) accessibility, c) safety and d) needs identified by Shafak. Shafak will prioritize the most vulnerable groups (e.g. women-headed HHs, HHs with members with chronic diseases, elderlies, ...etc. refer to the attached selection criteria. 

The beneficiaries will be selected based on a set of vulnerability criteria with a focus on the newly IDPs who left their hometowns during the last displacement and are in dire need of winterization and NFI assistance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the living conditions of conflict-affected populations through repairing of damaged houses and providing winterization needs while enhancing referral mechanisms to ensure accessibility and privacy for vulnerable groups in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project contributes to life-sustaining assistance to the most vulnerable groups in Northwest Syria Idleb governorate sub-districts of Dana and Qourqeena through the following two interventions that designed based on attached Need Assessment (Attachment.1):

Firstly, provision house repairing for /600/ of partly damaged houses&#x2014;Grade 2 for the IDPs and host communities (include 782 men, 836 women, 664 boys, and 718 girls). HLP due diligence will be included in implementation in order to achieve as much legal certainty about tenure as possible to ensure the security of tenure by verifying the ownership of the land or shelter and to prevent the exploitation and eviction of the IDPs. The percentage of IDPs will be 60%, and the rest will be from the host communities. Contractor- modality will be adopted of repairing houses, this modality supports an accountable, timely, and efficient use of resources while protecting the rights of the beneficiaries.

Secondly, provision winterization assistance (diesel stoves with accessories, diesel fuel) for the most vulnerable people 1350 HHs (include 1755 men, 1890 women, 1485 boys, and 1620 girls), 80% of the IDPs who living (outside camps) in the makeshift shelter or in damaged/unfinished buildings and they did not receive winter assistance in the past, also 20% of them host communities who meet the vulnerability criteria to avoid the sensitive. All the beneficiaries will be selected based on the vulnerability criteria, so the blanket distributions will be avoided.  The in-kind- modality will be adopted for distributions of the fuel and stoves. Diesel fuel was chosen for heating because it is the most common and available in the targeted areas, it is most efficient and relatively safe, so vulnerable HHs can install the stoves and use it easily, also it will be useful in cooking food in addition to heating. SRD will purchase them from local markets for revitalization, and will be responsible for quality control.

During the life of the project, SRD outreach workers will ensure that all vulnerable groups are involved in project activities, and will accompany the shelter teams during the door to door verification to detect of vulnerability cases in the beneficiaries&apos; houses and refer them to nearby SRD community centers to respond (Attachment.2). In addition, they will ensure that technical assessments conducted by shelter teams meet the demand of persons with disabilities and the elderly. Also, they will deliver awareness messages for beneficiaries who receiving the winterization assistance to protect from COVID-19 and ensuring that the distribution process in line with protection principles.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing emergency nutrition, health, and protection services for displaced children under 5 and PLWs by establishing 8 RRTs in addition to one OTP</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will cover 85,000 people, disaggregated as follows:
- 29,750 PLWs
- 55,250 Children under 5

One OTP center and 8 rapid response teams (RRTs) will be maintained and will continue to provide services in 
Idleb gt Idleb gt Maaret Tamsrin gt Kelly (OTP)
Idleb gt Harim gt Dana gt Qah (RRTs)

Each Rapid response team (RRT) will work in specific locations and will cover (pregnant and lactating women and children under 5)

These Rapid response teams will work in parallel and in coordination with the available health facilities in the target areas. The RRTs will provide integrated health, nutrition, child protection, and hygiene promotion.

Nurses will screen the children under 5 and refer the ones with dangers signs and medical problems to the available health facilities.

Community Health Workers (CHWs) will assess and screen nutritional status among the children under 5 and distribute nutritional supplies to them where needed. Also, the infant and young child feeding practices in emergencies (IYCF-E) services will be provided to prevent any case of malnutrition by:

- Counseling the PLWs and caregivers of children under 24 months of age and providing messages on IYCF-E recommended practices to mothers who have malnourished children. 
- Distributing micronutrients and nutrition supplies for the PLWs and children.
- Reporting to the cluster any distribution of breast milk substitute.

Midwives will screen pregnant and lactating women and refer the ones with any danger signs or medical problems to the nearest facilities. 

Also, a pre and rapid coordination combined with referrals will be in place if the team notices or identifies any sign of abuse or violence among children under 5 and or mothers. All cases of violence against women and children will be referred to a pre-identified center.

Continue to support the OTP center in Kelly PHC Maaret Tamsrin.
This facility will provide treatment of severe acute malnutrition (without complications) for all boys and girls under 5 and IYCF counseling will be provided to their mothers. 
This response will adopt the recommendation of the cluster in COVID-19 context to minimize the risk of infection for staff and beneficiaries through:

- Mercy-USA will apply recommended IPC measures at RRTs sites 
- IYCF-E counseling and messages could be conducted via WhatsApp 
- Screen and isolate all beneficiaries with suspected COVID-19 at entrance point of OTP site. 
-Dissemination of information on COVID-19 signs, symptoms and IPC measures 
-All other needed measures will apply according to the cluster recommendation 

Also, this project will involve empowering mothers and HH members through training to screen their own children for malnutrition by teaching them how to use color-coded Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tapes and check for oedema.</narrative>
