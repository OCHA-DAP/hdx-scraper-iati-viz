   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed one-year project will contribute to the following outcomes by addressing at the national level key issues of targeting and quality of social protection and in the two districts through an integrated package focused on strengthening systems and access to social protection and social services for women and children in poor and vulnerable communities by end of July 2021 through the following actions:
I. Enhanced capacity of essential services and personnel to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks and provide quality health, nutrition, child protection, GBV, water, hygiene, waste management and sanitation services to underserved women, children and vulnerable communities in Gazipur District and City Corporation.II. Advocate to expand the coverage and strengthen effectiveness of national social protection system and ensure the urgent release, reunification, and reintegration of children in juvenile detention facilities and other institutions. III. Integrated support to the Bangladeshi host communities and Rohingya refugees undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the 200 bed SARI ITC in Teknaf, CxB District.
The proposed interventions will be implemented under the leadership of GoB within the existing structures including those at institutional and community levels. Systems strengthening, preparedness, and addressing key underlying issues will support governments efforts to improve effectiveness of national social security system and to suppress COVID-19 in the two districts. In CxB for instance, it is projected that at least 1,000 beds will be needed for an isolation and treatment centre for the expected COVID-19 cases both for Rohingya refugees and the host communities. In Gazipur, systems issues will be addressed to ensure adequate access to integrated social services.
Evidence will be developed for policy engagement and policy influencing on social protection, public health and basic service delivery both in urban and rural Bangladesh. The interventions will also reduce protection risks for children and women including physical violence, trafficking, early marriages and child labour which are prevalent in the two districts.
Lastly, the proposed budget of USD 3,108,949.80 will support the stipulated interventions, strengthening systems and communities, addressing underlying fragilities towards a more resilient approach to lower transmission of COVID-19 and to better respond to future public health challenges in Bangladesh.</narrative>

World Food Programme (WFP) in Bangladesh has, together with Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) applied to Sida for funding of 30 million SEK to carry out the &quot;Cross-sectoral response to the COVID-19 instigated food and nutrition security crisis in Bangladesh&quot; during the period 2020-2021, starting in November 2020.

The project is a part of the larger country strategic programme of World Food Programme, Bangladesh and aims to responds to critical food security needs for ultra-poor following the COVID-19 outbreak and the following socio-economic effects. The project specifically aims to increase access to, and availability of, fresh food commodities at affordable buying prices for urban poor, and to strengthen the supply chain of the commodities so that the rural farmers can produce and sell those commodities at reasonable prices. 

The project will target a total population of 17,500 (3500 households from urban areas and 2500 farmers from rural areas) people living in low-income, at-risk, urban (Dhaka north) and rural areas (neighborhoods in Dhaka). The interventions in urban areas will focus on at-risk, low-income urban areas, where there will be an effort to (1) (re) establish a regular supply of fresh food to the inhabitants of the identified and targeted areas, and (2) provide direct cash assistance to poor and vulnerable living in these areas (and who meet specific selection criteria) . The interventions in rural areas will focus on the protection of the food and nutrition security and livelihoods of vulnerable rural households through (re) establishing linkages with market and food supply-chains to the targeted areas in urban centers. These activities will increase income and employment opportunities, create access to poor and vulnerable people to work as a producer, worker and/or consumer in the entire supply chain.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the project is to target (urban) households and (rural) farmers most impacted by COVID-19 and restore broken supply chains. The expected outcome is: Enhanced food and nutrition security and improved diets of nutritionally vulnerable household members, including pregnant and lactating women and young children.
The contribution will address the food security needs of 20,000 beneficiaries; i.e. 17,500 individuals (3500 households) in at-risk low-income urban areas of Dhaka and smaller urban municipalities near Dhaka, with a focus on establishing linkages with 2,500 local smallholder farmers in semi-rural and rural areas of Dhaka North City Corporation (linking to smallholder farmers and producer organizations in Cumilla district, Chittagong).&#xA0;
The programme is designed over a ten-month period, in order to sustain the short-term impact of the programme on household-level food security, and to create a model that the government can replicate and scale up. Recognising that the COVID-19 crisis is ongoing, and at risk of escalating, and that the full repercussions of the national lockdown is not yet known, the project has a built-in flexibility to adjust to a changing situation.&#xA0;
The programme has following objective and outcomes:
Objective:&#xA0;Enhance Food security for households most affected by the COVID-19 crisis in at-risk low-income urban areas
Outcome 1: Most affected HHs by the COVID-19 crisis have enhanced food security
Outcome 2: Re-established and regular supply of fresh food to the inhabitants of the identified and targeted areas</narrative>

Ans&#xF6;kande organisation
Diakonia &#xE4;r en ideell bist&#xE5;ndsorganisation med kristen v&#xE4;rdegrund. Svenska Alliansmissionen och Equmeniakyrkan &#xE4;r dess huvudm&#xE4;n. Diakonia har bedrivit bist&#xE5;ndsverksamhet med fokus p&#xE5; demokrati och m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter sedan 1966. Diakonia samarbetar med de mest utsatta grupperna i samh&#xE4;llet, oavsett tro, etnicitet eller k&#xF6;n, och inom n&#xE5;gra av de mest ifr&#xE5;gasatta m&#xE4;nniskor&#xE4;ttsfr&#xE5;gorna i respektive land som t ex HBTQI r&#xE4;ttigheter.  

Diakonias huvudkontor i Stockholm arbetar med insamling, folkbildning, information, opinionsbildning och administration. H&#xE4;rifr&#xE5;n utg&#xE5;r ocks&#xE5; tematisk r&#xE5;dgivning, metodutveckling och samordning av det internationella arbetet. Diakonia implementerar inte sj&#xE4;lv aktiviteter utan f&#xF6;rmedlar pengar till lokala partners i kombination med att bygga kunskap och kapacitet relaterat till organisationssystem och tematiska fr&#xE5;gor. Organisationen &#xE4;r decentraliserad med fyra regionkontor som st&#xE5;r f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vergripande samordning och 25 landskontor. Landkontoren sk&#xF6;ter samarbetet med, och uppf&#xF6;ljning av, Diakonias totalt ca 400 samarbetsorganisationer. M&#xE5;let med det kapacitetsbyggande som Diakonia genomf&#xF6;r &#xE4;r att bidra till att starka lokala organisationer byggs som i sin tur bidrar till att f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar genomf&#xF6;rs d&#xE4;r dessa f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar &#xE4;gs av m&#xE5;lgrupperna. Visionen i Diakonias strategi 2021-2025 &#xE4;r &#x201D;en r&#xE4;ttvis, j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lld och h&#xE5;llbar v&#xE4;rld&#x201D; och strategins &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;ls&#xE4;ttning &#xE4;r att &#x201D;f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndra or&#xE4;ttvisa strukturer - politiska, ekonomiska, sociala och kulturella &#x2013; som genererar fattigdom och oj&#xE4;mlikhet samt f&#xF6;rtryck och v&#xE5;ld&#x201D;. Diakonia framh&#xE5;ller att det kr&#xE4;vs ett s&#xE4;rskilt arbete f&#xF6;r r&#xE4;ttvisa mellan k&#xF6;nen f&#xF6;r att uppn&#xE5; sin vision. D&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r har organisationen tagit fram feministiska principer som de nu kommer arbeta utifr&#xE5;n. Det &#xE4;r p&#xE5; detta s&#xE4;tt de vill f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndra or&#xE4;ttvisa strukturer p&#xE5; djupet.

Ans&#xF6;kan
Ans&#xF6;kan fr&#xE5;n Diakonia med titeln Shifting contexts, Supporting Change, Transforming Societies (&#x201D;skiftande kontexter, st&#xF6;dja f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar, transformera samh&#xE4;llen&#x201D;), inkom till Sida i oktober 2020. Ans&#xF6;kan g&#xE4;ller fortsatt samarbete &#xE5;ren 2021-2025 inom CSO-strategin. Den totala budgeten f&#xF6;r insatsen uppg&#xE5;r till ca 899 MSEK. Ans&#xF6;kt bidrag fr&#xE5;n Sida &#xE4;r 815 MSEK. Verksamheten som inkluderas i ans&#xF6;kan h&#xE4;nvisas h&#xE4;danefter till som CSO-programmet. Den ska implementeras genom 24 landprogram och ca 160 lokala partners &#xF6;ver Afrika, Asien, Mellan&#xF6;stern/Nordafrika och Latinamerika, samt via ett globalt program. Diakonias samarbetspartner utg&#xF6;rs av religi&#xF6;sa och icke-religi&#xF6;sa n&#xE4;tverk och organisationer inom civila samh&#xE4;llet, m&#xE4;nniskor&#xE4;ttsf&#xF6;rsvarare, koalitioner och allianser. Det &#xE4;r kvinnoorganisationer, grupper som representerar urbefolkningar, r&#xF6;relser f&#xF6;r personer med funktionsvariationer och ungdomsr&#xF6;relser.

Diakonia kommer fortsatt att arbeta med fokus p&#xE5; omr&#xE5;dena demokrati, m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter och j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhetsfr&#xE5;gor. Tre organisatoriska f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar planeras. Den f&#xF6;rsta av de tre organisatoriska f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringarna &#xE4;r att i framtiden utg&#xE5; fr&#xE5;n kontextuella m&#xF6;jligheter/utmaningar, processer samt deras nya f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringsteori. Denna f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring &#xE4;r ett avsteg fr&#xE5;n tidigare tematiskt styrda program. Detta, menar Diakonia, kommer leda till &#xF6;kad flexibilitet i hur de kan svara p&#xE5; en f&#xF6;r&#xE4;nderlig utveckling. Den andra organisatoriska f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringen &#xE4;r att organisationen kommer arbeta utifr&#xE5;n feministiska principer. Denna f&#xF6;rflyttning menar de introducerar en politisk dimension i arbetet som i sin tur f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rker deras fortsatta arbete med j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet och uttalade ambition att uppn&#xE5; j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet. Den tredje f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringen &#xE4;r att basen f&#xF6;r samarbeten breddas och nya typer av samarbeten ing&#xE5;s, t ex med nya f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringsakt&#xF6;rer. Ett &#xF6;kat fokus p&#xE5; Diakonia som en l&#xE4;rande organisation samt ett &#xF6;kat fokus p&#xE5; bist&#xE5;ndseffektivitet d&#xE4;r k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d ska vara en utg&#xE5;ngspunkt, &#xE4;r f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rkningar som planeras i verksamheten. Det ska ocks&#xE5; finnas en tydligare koppling mellan k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d och kapacitetsutveckling, ett st&#xF6;rre fokus p&#xE5; innovation och utveckling av partners kompetens.

Applying organization 
Diakonia is a non-profit development organization with work grounded in Christian values. The Swedish Alliance Mission and the Equmenia Church are its principals. Diakonia has been conducting development work with a focus on democracy and human rights since 1966. Diakonia supports the most vulnerable groups in society, regardless of religion, ethnicity or gender, and focuses its work on some of the most controversial human rights issues in the countries where they operate, such as LGBTQI rights.

Diakonia&apos;s head office in Stockholm fundraises, conducts public education, disseminates public information, works with opinion formations and is responsible for the overall administration of the organisation. Thematic advice to, and method development for partners in local contexts as well as coordination of the international work also departs from the head office. Diakonia is not an implementing organization but forwards funds to local partners work in development contexts, in combination with capacity building to strengthen organizational systems and thematic competence. The organization is decentralized with four regional offices with responsibilities for overall coordination and 25 country offices.The country offices are responsible for collaboration with, and follow-up of, Diakonia&apos;s almost 400 local partner organizations. The goal of the capacity building that Diakonia carries out is to contribute to building strong local organizations, which in turn contribute to changes in the communities and where these changes are owned by the target groups. The Diakonia strategy 2021-2025 vision is &quot;a fair, equal and sustainable world&quot; and the overall goal of the strategy is to &quot;change unjust structures - political, economic, social and cultural - that generate poverty and inequality as well as oppression and violence&quot;. Diakonia emphasizes that special work for gender equality is required to achieve its vision. Therefore, the organization has developed feminist principles from which their work will now depart and in order to address underlying causes to inequality.

The application 
Diakonia&apos;s application entitled &#x201C;Changing contexts, supporting change, transforming societies&#x201D;, was received by Sida in October 2020. Below the application is referred to as the CSO-program. The application seeks continued cooperation with Sida for the years 2021-2025 under the CSO-strategy. The total budget for the CSO-program amounts to approximately MSEK 899. The grant applied for from Sida amounts to MSEK 815. The CSO program will be implemented through 24 country programs and about 160 local partners across Africa, Asia, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America, as well as through a global program. Diakonia&apos;s partners constitute religious and non-religious networks and civil society organizations, human rights defenders, coalitions and alliances. In real terms these are women&apos;s organizations, groups representing indigenous peoples, movements for people with functional variations and youth movements. Diakonia will continue to work with a focus on democracy, human rights and gender equality. Three organizational transformations are planned. The first of the three transformations is to depart all work from contextual opportunities/challenges, processes and their new theory of change. This change is a departure from previous thematically steered programs. The move, according to Diakonia, will enable increased flexibility in how they can respond to changing developments in the contexts where they work. The second organizational transformation is that the organization will work on the basis of feminist principles. According to Diakonia, this shift introduces a political dimension to the work on equality, which in turn strengthens their continued work in this area and the ambition to achieve gender equality. The third transformation is to broaden the basis for collaborations and enter into new types of collaborations, for example with new actors for change. An increased focus on Diakonia as a learning organization and an increased focus on aid effectiveness, where core support will be a point of departure for support, are reinforcements that are planned in the business. There shall also be a clearer link between core support and capacity building, a greater focus on innovation and on the development of partners&apos; skills.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic is having a major disruptive effect on the lives of young people in the Western Balkans. The overall consequences of the pandemic have left many young people feeling isolated, stressed and uncertain about their education, employment, or a stable income and their futures. The closures of schools are disproportionately impacting disadvantaged youth who have fewer educational opportunities outside of school. Young people are also particularly hard hit by job losses as they tend to hold more precarious jobs, have less work experience and hold contracting arrangements that are less protective of their rights than older workers. All of this has detrimental consequences to their mental health and wellbeing, as young people try to adapt and thrive in a very uncertain future, increasingly seeing migration as a solution.

In this contribution &#x201C;Generation Unlimited in Western Balkans&#x201D;, 2020-2021, UNICEF intends to respond to the needs of young people in Western Balkans related to the uncertainties of Covid-19. The Generation Unlimited (GenU) secretariat has selected Kosovo as the front runner in the upcoming project in Western Balkans. GenU is a global multi-sector partnership to meet the urgent need for expanded education, training and employment opportunities for young people, aged 10 to 24, on an unprecedented scale. As a front runner for GENU, UNICEF office in Kosovo plays a leading and catalyst role for UNICEF offices in Western Balkans in exploring scalable solutions for youth empowerment and employment. GenU will bring together UNICEF, private sector aims to provide at least 500 young people with internships in the private sector, government, civil society organizations and young people to address the urgent need to invest on bridging secondary- age education and training, employment and entrepreneurship opportunities to young people. 

During 2020 Sida intends to support the contribution as one part in the establishing of GenU on Western Balkans and give response to the particular vulnerability of youths due to the economic consequences of COVID-19.  
 
The expected results of the contribution to &#x201C;Generation Unlimited in Western Balkans&#x201D; is to:

a) at least 500 young people are trained and certified and provided with the opportunity to conduct paid internship in private sector, government, NGO&#x2019;s, UN Agencies and other organizations.
b) the match-making and virtual learning platform for internship will be developed and provide with online-learning opportunities for young people. Learning component will combine best educational and business practices for the 21st century skills needed for young people. 
c) at least 50 businesses, NGO and central and local level institutions will be mobilized to host internship placement of young people;
d) a regional GenU initiative action plan will be developed. 

The following project activities will be performed:
 
1)	Identify and empower private sector enterprises and other institutions to host young people The GenU platform will facilitate the process and bring together private sector enterprises, civil society organizations, local and central level institutions and other international organizations to host interns. However, as the most important hosting with capacities and interest to improve their performance and respond to the issue of COVID-19 are private sector businesses. Through the CSR network, only during the launch of the project 22 businesses (members of CSR) and their leaders are on board. In addition, CSR Network will play the convening role to enhance partnership by bringing more private enterprises on board to reach its total of 100 members in a 1-year period. 
2)	Develop and deploy a matching platform that will enable 3 months paid internship for young people: the proposed model intends a) empower young people and prepare for the world of work, b) contributing to recovering and backing on track with the business performance and operations through youth&#x2019;s labour, and c) contribute to the government and society. The contribution produces a win-win situation for all actors involved. The scheme foresees regular payments for interns for three (3) months and as well their health insurance at work. To produce a win-win situation, through the Banking Association of Kosovo, monthly payment will be directed through the banking accounts and an online financial literacy session will be provided through the online-learning platform. In addition to benefits for young people&#x2019;s skills building and development in their careers, the paid internship will help young people with income for their families and boost the general consumption. 
3)	Develop a Reginal GenU action plan
With the objective of developing a Regional GenU action plan and sharing of best practices, towards the end of the project, a Regional Workshop will be organized with representatives from UNICEF Country Offices, private sector and government institutions from neighbouring Albania and North Macedonia. This workshop will serve to discuss the prospects and the vision for scale up of the GenU into a regional initiative affecting thousands of young people.
  
The 9 months implementation of the project will include the first phase of establishment of the GenU platform with its secretariat; second phase of identification of institutions and private firms that will host young people for paid internships, and third and final phase of documentation and development of the Regional Genu initiative action plan. Planned budget for the intervention is 4 000 000 SEK.   

Increased inclusion of young people in the labor market has great potential to contribute to rising productivity, not least among SMEs. Increased employment among young people is expected to reduce emigration and gives the opportunity for them to influence the development of their own lives. Thus, the contribution will contribute to the Sweden&#xB4;s Results Strategy for reform cooperation with Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans and Turkey, 2014-2020, specifically to result area 1 and 2:

1) Enhanced economic integration with the EU and development of market economy
2) Strengthened democracy, greater respect for human rights and a more fully developed state under the rule of law.

The intervention is considered as Sida&#x2019;s response to Covid-19.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Nya medel/medeltill&#xE4;gg f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
COVID-19-pandemin har stora ogynnsamma effekter p&#xE5; unga m&#xE4;nniskors liv p&#xE5; V&#xE4;stra Balkan. De &#xF6;vergripande konsekvenserna kopplade till pandemin har p&#xE5;verkat att m&#xE5;nga unga personer k&#xE4;nner sig isolerade, stressade och os&#xE4;kra kring utbildning, anst&#xE4;llning och/eller stabil inkomst samt deras framtid. Nedst&#xE4;ngningar av skolor p&#xE5;verkar unga fr&#xE5;n ogynnsamma f&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llanden ytterligare d&#xE5; de erh&#xE5;ller f&#xE4;rre utbildningsm&#xF6;jligheter utanf&#xF6;r skolan. Unga &#xE4;r ocks&#xE5; specifikt utsatta f&#xF6;r upps&#xE4;gning, d&#xE5; de vanligtvis har prek&#xE4;ra arbeten, har mindre arbetslivserfarenhet och erh&#xE5;ller kontrakt med s&#xE4;mre skydd f&#xF6;r arbetarens r&#xE4;ttigheter &#xE4;n &#xE4;ldre anst&#xE4;llda. Detta ger skadliga konsekvenser f&#xF6;r unga m&#xE4;nniskors psykiska h&#xE4;lsa och v&#xE4;lbefinnande, d&#xE5; de f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;ker adaptera och v&#xE4;xa i en os&#xE4;ker framtid, vilket &#xF6;kar tanken p&#xE5; migration som en l&#xF6;sning.

I denna insats &#x201D;Generation Unlimited in Western Balkans&#x201D;, 2020 &#x2013; 2021, &#xE4;mnar UNICEF m&#xF6;ta de ungas behov p&#xE5; V&#xE4;stra Balkan kopplat till os&#xE4;kerheterna kring f&#xF6;ljderna av COVID-19. Sekretariatet p&#xE5; Generation Unlimited (GenU) har utsett Kosovo som pilotprojekt f&#xF6;r projektet p&#xE5; V&#xE4;stra Balkan. GenU &#xE4;r ett globalt multisektoriellt partnerskap f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta de br&#xE5;dskande behoven av ut&#xF6;kad utbildning, tr&#xE4;ning och anst&#xE4;llningsm&#xF6;jligheter f&#xF6;r unga mellan 10 och 24 &#xE5;r. Som pilot f&#xF6;r GenU kommer UNICEF:s kontor i Kosovo inneha en ledande och katalyserande roll f&#xF6;r andra UNICEF:s kontor p&#xE5; V&#xE4;stra Balkan, att unders&#xF6;ka och utveckla skalbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r ungas befogenheter och anst&#xE4;llningsbarhet. GenU avser att inledas i V&#xE4;stra Balkan med syfte att f&#xF6;ra samman UNICEF, den privata sektorn och unga personer. 

Sida avser att st&#xF6;dja med en punktinsats under 2020 som ett led i etableringen av GenU p&#xE5; V&#xE4;stra Balkan och ge respons p&#xE5; ungdomars s&#xE4;rskilda utsatthet till f&#xF6;ljd av de ekonomiska konsekvenserna av COVID19.  
F&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade resultat av punktinsatsen till &#x201D;Generation Unlimited in Western Balkans&#x201D; &#xE4;r att:

a)  Minst 500 unga personer ska ha blivit tr&#xE4;nade, certifierade och f&#xF6;rsedda med m&#xF6;jligheten att genomf&#xF6;ra betald praktik i privat sektor, NGOs, FN-organ eller andra organisationer.
b) En matchning och en virtuell l&#xE4;roplattform f&#xF6;r praktik ska ha utvecklats och f&#xF6;rsett unga m&#xE4;nniskor med m&#xF6;jlighet till online-l&#xE4;rande. L&#xE4;rokomponenten ska kombinera den b&#xE4;sta utbildningen och f&#xF6;retagspraxis och kompetenser som unga personer beh&#xF6;ver detta &#xE5;rhundrade.
c) Minst 50 f&#xF6;retag, NGOs och centrala och lokala institutioner ska vara mobiliserade f&#xF6;r erh&#xE5;lla platser f&#xF6;r unga praktikanter.
d) En handlingsplan f&#xF6;r den regionala GenU f&#xF6;r V&#xE4;stra Balkan ska ha tagits fram.

F&#xF6;ljande projektaktiviteter kommer att genomf&#xF6;ras:

1)	Identifiera och st&#xE4;rka privata f&#xF6;retags och andra institutioner att st&#xE5; som v&#xE4;rdar f&#xF6;r unga personer. 
GenU-plattformen kommer facilitera processen och f&#xF6;ra samman privata f&#xF6;retagssektorn, civilsamh&#xE4;llesorganisationer, lokala och centrala niv&#xE5;er av institutioner och andra internationella organisationer att ta emot unga m&#xE4;nniskor som praktikanter som en v&#xE4;g in i arbetslivet. I detta bed&#xF6;ms den privata f&#xF6;retagssektorn som den viktigaste mottagaren, med kapacitet och intresse att bidra och ge respons p&#xE5; ungdomars bristande tilltro till framtiden som accentuerats i samband med COVID-19. Enbart under lanseringstiden har redan 22 f&#xF6;retag och deras ledning anslutit sig till initiativet genom Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)-n&#xE4;tverket. Deras medlemmar &#xE4;r lokala och internationella akt&#xF6;rer fr&#xE5;n n&#xE4;ringslivet. CSR N&#xE4;tverket kommer ha den sammankallande rollen f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka partnerskapet vad avser att vidga kretsen av anslutna privata f&#xF6;retag.
2)	Utveckla och sprida en matchningsplattform som kommer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra 3 m&#xE5;nader betald praktik f&#xF6;r unga m&#xE4;nniskor.
Den f&#xF6;reslagna modellen avser att: a) f&#xF6;rbereda ungdomarna f&#xF6;r arbetslivet b) bidra till f&#xF6;retagens &#xE5;terh&#xE4;mtning med ungdomarnas arbetskraft och c)bidra till samh&#xE4;llet i stort och regeringen. Insatsen skapar ett merv&#xE4;rde f&#xF6;r samtliga involverade parter. Planen inneb&#xE4;r regelbundna utbetalningar till praktikanterna under tre m&#xE5;nader samt h&#xE4;lsof&#xF6;rs&#xE4;kring p&#xE5; arbetet. Utbetalningarna riktas genom bankkonton samt kommer finansiell online-utbildning erbjudas genom den e-baserade l&#xE4;roplattformen. Ut&#xF6;ver de f&#xF6;rdelar som kompetensutvecklingen ger f&#xF6;r deras karri&#xE4;rer, kommer den betalda praktiken hj&#xE4;lpa unga personer med inkomst till deras familjer och &#xF6;ka den generella konsumtionen.  

3)	Utveckla en regional genomf&#xF6;randeplan f&#xF6;r GenU.
Med m&#xE5;let att utveckla en genomf&#xF6;randeplan f&#xF6;r GenU och dela b&#xE4;sta praxis, mot slutet av projektet, kommer en regional workshop organiseras med representanter fr&#xE5;n UNICEF:s landskontor, privata sektorn och statliga institutioner fr&#xE5;n grannl&#xE4;nderna Albanien och Nordmakedonien. Workshopen kommer syfta till att diskutera utsikterna och visionen f&#xF6;r att skala upp GenU WB till ett regionalt initiativ som p&#xE5;verkar tusentals unga personer.

Implementeringen av projektet kommer under de kommande 9 m&#xE5;naderna inkludera etablerande av en GenU-plattform med sekretariatet i f&#xF6;rsta fasen, identifiera institutioner och privata f&#xF6;retag som tar emot unga personer f&#xF6;r betalda praktikplatser i fas tv&#xE5; och dokumentera och utveckla en regional GenU-initiativhandlingsplan i fas tre. Ber&#xE4;knad budget f&#xF6;r insatsen &#xE4;r 4 000 000 SEK.  

Insatsen f&#xF6;resl&#xE5;s genomf&#xF6;ras som ett led i Sidas rapida respons till COVID-19. D&#xE4;rtill bed&#xF6;ms insatsen som strategisk i f&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llande till det nyligen beslutade regionala samarbetet mellan Sida, UNICEF och Naturv&#xE5;rdsverket.

&#xD6;kad inklusion av unga p&#xE5; arbetsmarknaden har stora m&#xF6;jligheter att bidra till stigande produktivitet, inte minst bland sm&#xE5; och medelstora f&#xF6;retag. &#xD6;kad syssels&#xE4;ttning bland unga f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas minska emigration och &#xF6;ka m&#xF6;jligheten f&#xF6;r unga att p&#xE5;verka utvecklingen av sina egna liv. D&#xE4;rmed bed&#xF6;ms insatsen ocks&#xE5; vara relevant f&#xF6;r m&#xE5;l 1 och 2 i den regionala strategin, Resultatstrategi f&#xF6;r Sveriges reformsamarbete med &#xD6;steuropa, V&#xE4;stra Balkan och Turkiet 2014 &#x2013; 2020:
1) &#xD6;kad ekonomisk integrering med EU och marknadsekonomisk utveckling. 
2) St&#xE4;rkt demokrati, &#xF6;kad respekt f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter och en mer utvecklad r&#xE4;ttsstat

Den f&#xF6;reslagna insatsen ligger ocks&#xE5; i linje med f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade prioriteringar i den kommande strategin f&#xF6;r svenskt utvecklingssamarbete p&#xE5; V&#xE4;stra Balkan.</narrative>

Det f&#xF6;religgande projektet har till syfte att st&#xF6;dja Albaniens regering i dess insatser f&#xF6;r att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra landets DRM-system. Projektets &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att st&#xE4;rka Albaniens DRM-system och att st&#xF6;dja landets insatser f&#xF6;r att kunna bli en fullv&#xE4;rdig medlem av EU:s civilskyddsmekanism. Mot bakgrund av den sv&#xE5;ra och akuta folkh&#xE4;lsokris som uppkommit till f&#xF6;ljd av den globala covid-19 pandemin kommer &#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder relaterade till riskberedskap och riskreducering f&#xF6;r biologiska faror att tillhandah&#xE5;llas.
Det ovan angivna m&#xE5;let kommer att uppn&#xE5;s genom f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad institutionell samordning och samarbete inom DRM-system via vidareutveckling av ramverket f&#xF6;r katastrofriskreducering (&#x201C;DRR&#x201D;), direktst&#xF6;d till viktiga DRM-institutioner, med s&#xE4;rskild fokus p&#xE5; den nationella myndigheten f&#xF6;r civilskydd, samt leverans av kapacitetsuppbyggnad f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka nationella, regionala och kommunala institutioners beredskaps- och insatskapacitet.
Insatsen omfattar en upps&#xE4;ttning prioriteringar p&#xE5; flera niv&#xE5;er inom tre omr&#xE5;den: 1) f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rkning av DRR-ramverket och kapaciteten p&#xE5; central niv&#xE5;, 2) uppbyggnad av lokal DRR-kunskap, planerings och organisatoriska kapacitet f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rebyggande insatser och beredskap vid katastrofer, och 3) st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r kritiska behov inom infrastrukturen f&#xF6;r katastrofriskhantering.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Resilience Strengthening in Albania Project (RESEAL) has been developed as a
comprehensive response to the needs for strengthening the Disaster Risk Management
(DRM) systems at all levels following the devastating effects of the Earthquake that hit the country in November 26th. 
The present project intends to support the efforts of the Government of Albania for
improving the disaster risk management (DRM) system in the country. The overall
objective of the project is to strengthen, Albania&#x2019;s DRM system and support country&#x2019;s
efforts in becoming a fully-fledged member of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. In light of the severe and acute public health emergency due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, measures related to risk preparedness and risk mitigation of biological hazards will be provided.
The above objective will be attained through supporting the enhancement of and
improvement of institutional coordination and cooperation in DRM system by further
developing the DRR framework, providing direct support to key DRM institutions with
a particular focus on the National Agency for Civil Protection, and delivering capacity
building for strengthening preparedness and response capacities of the national,
prefecture and municipal bodies.
The intervention contains a multi-level set of priorities around three areas: 1) strengthening the DRR framework and capacities at the central level, 2) building DRR local level knowledge, planning and organizational capacities for prevention and response to disasters, and 3) supporting critical needs for Disaster Risk Reduction infrastructure.

Due to its complexity, the intervention is structured in two major modules. The module I focuses on essential building blocks related to the overall DRR framework including policy, legal and institutional set-up and essential capacities in place, and is designed as a soft assistance. Module II allows for expansion and adoption by especially focusing on securing capital resources for improved monitoring, operation and response for several relevant public institutions ranging from the NACP, prefectural operation rooms and municipal firefighting professionals. 
Swedish contribution will be focused to Module 1 which is built around three components:
Component 1: Strengthening DRM institutional, policy and legal framework in Albania;
Component 2: Strengthening disaster preparedness capacities at all levels;
Component 3: Sustain Albania&#x2019;s Regional &amp; International Cooperation.
Sweden&#x2019;s financial contribution, like that of the other donors, will be disbursed into the trust fund andadministered from UNDP with the GoA through the Ministry of Defense and the
national Civil Protection Agency Agency (NCPA), being in the lead for activity planning
and inter-institutional coordination.</narrative>

The overall objective of the project is to strengthen, Albania&#x2019;s DRM system and support country&#x2019;s efforts in becoming a fully-fledged member of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The project is also in line with promoting the implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) and is developed based on the Albania earthquake PDNA recommendations. Also, in light of the severe and acute public health emergency due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, measures related to risk preparedness and risk mitigation of biological hazards will be provided.

The project will, in parallel, initiate the Capacity Development Process for the Disaster Risk Management System in Albania, which is indispensable for risk-informed development effectiveness and the achievement of nationally and internationally agreed development targets, and assist prefecture and municipal levels through supporting institutional building as per the legal requirements and the exercises of local risk assessment, local DRR strategies and Emergency Plans.&#xA0;One key ingredient of the DRR legal framework and essential element for building-back-better (BBB) during recovery is the update of the Building Codes, an area within the focus of the proposed intervention.
The project will support, during its entire duration, opportunities for capacity building and regional exchanges in order to complement national efforts for reducing risk and contributing to Albania&#x2019;s aspiration to meet the criteria for joining the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.
Due to its complexity, the intervention is&#xA0; structured&#xA0; in two major modules, in line with the PDNA priorities. The module I focuses on essential building blocks related to the overall DRR framework including policy, legal and institutional&#xA0; set-up and essential capacities in place, and is designed as a soft assistance. Module II allows for expansion and adoption by especially focusing on securing capital resources for improved monitoring, operation and response for several relevant public institutions ranging from the NACP, prefectural operation rooms and municipal firefighting professionals. The second module is the most demanding in terms of resources and, therefore, it will largely depend on resource availability. However,&#xA0; being mostly about procurement of goods, it will not require additional human resources and operational costs, but will rely on the project arrangements, resources and operational costs built within the first module.
&#xA0;The intervention is built around three components:
Component 1: Strengthening DRM institutional, policy and legal framework in Albania;
Component 2: Strengthening disaster preparedness capacities at all levels;
Component 3: Sustain Albania&#x2019;s Regional &amp;amp; International Cooperation.
In order to secure that the allocated funding is used for the most crucial and high priority actions, UNDP and GoA have developed a Work Plan for the project based only on resources to be provided by UNDP Albania and Sweden. All the activities and planned results belong to module 1 and the RESEAL Work Plan document will be the guiding tool for the implementation of the intervention.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread the world, what initially was a health-related crisis has now struck the global economy as a whole. As entire countries have shut down, borders have been closed and global value chains interrupted, the pandemic has gotten negative effects on global food security, which already before the pandemic was threatened by the spread of locusts in Eastern Africa. Without responding to these new risks that face people living in poverty, decades of progress on food security risk being set back.

Through a support of 50 million SEK to International Fund for Agricultural Development&apos;s (IFAD&apos;s) Rural Poor Stimulus Facility (RPSF), Sida is contributing to improving the resilience for the rural poor. The facility serves to contribute to IFAD funded projects in order to ensure that they have the capacity and funds required to adapt their operations to the new situation that COVID-19 poses. The facility can also contribute to national or regional specific projects that have been generated by IFAD&apos;s country teams together with their partners in order to locally respond to the pandemic. IFAD is currently funding more than 200 projects in more than 100 countries, which in total affect 110 million people, many of them the rural poor. When food production and the food market as a result of the pandemic is disrupted because of interrupted value chains, shut-down markets and market volatility, the rural poor risk great income losses, food insecurity and poverty. To avoid that a crisis turns into a catastrophe, Sida is supporting RPSF in order to sustain market function in the service of the rural poor.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Nya medel/medeltill&#xE4;gg f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
I och med Covid-19 pandemins utbredning i v&#xE4;rlden har vad som ursprungligen var en h&#xE4;lsorelaterad fr&#xE5;ga p&#xE5;verkat v&#xE4;rldsekonomin i sin helhet.&#xA0;Till f&#xF6;ljd av nedst&#xE4;ngningar av hela l&#xE4;nder, st&#xE4;ngda gr&#xE4;nser och brutna v&#xE4;rde- och leveranskedjor har pandemin f&#xE5;tt mycket negativa effekter p&#xE5; den globala livsmedelss&#xE4;kerheten, som redan innan pandemin tog f&#xE4;ste var hotad av &#xF6;kengr&#xE4;shoppornas spridning i &#xF6;stra Afrika. Utan att bem&#xF6;ta dessa nya risker som drabbar m&#xE4;nniskor som lever i fattigdom riskerar &#xE5;rtionden av framsteg inom livsmedelstrygghet att raseras.

Genom ett st&#xF6;d om 50 MSEK till International Fund for Agricultural Developments (IFAD:s) Rural Poor Stimulus Facility (RPSF) vill Sida bidra till att skapa en resiliens hos m&#xE4;nniskor som lever i fattigdom p&#xE5; landsbygden. Facilitetens syfte &#xE4;r att bidra med ut&#xF6;kade medel till IFAD:s befintliga program f&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla att de har kapacitet och resurser att st&#xE4;lla om sin verksamhet f&#xF6;r den nya situation de befinner sig i som ett resultat av Covid-19-pandemin.&#xA0; Faciliteten kan ocks&#xE5; bidra med landsspecifika eller region-specifika st&#xF6;d till projekt som IFAD:s landsteam har skapat tillsammans med deras partners i syfte att mitigera Covid-19s negativa effekter p&#xE5; lokal niv&#xE5;. IFAD finansierar f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande &#xF6;ver 200 projekt i &#xF6;ver 100 l&#xE4;nder, vilka sammanlagt ber&#xF6;r 110 miljoner m&#xE4;nniskor, m&#xE5;nga av dem sm&#xE5;skaliga jordbrukare som lever i fattigdom. N&#xE4;r livsmedelsproduktionen och livsmedelsmarknaden som ett resultat av pandemin st&#xF6;rs av brutna leveranskedjor, nedst&#xE4;ngda marknader samt marknadsvolatilitet riskerar dessa m&#xE4;nniskor att lida v&#xE4;ldigt stora inkomstf&#xF6;rluster, livsmedelsotrygghet och fattigdom. F&#xF6;r att undvika att en kris blir en katastrof vill Sida d&#xE4;rmed st&#xF6;dja RPSF i syfte att uppr&#xE4;tth&#xE5;lla marknaders funktion f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nniskor som lever i fattigdom p&#xE5; landsbygden.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">NALED har ans&#xF6;kt hos Sida om finansiering med 14 394 920 kronor f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra projektet &quot;Offentlig upphandling f&#xF6;r ekonomisk tillv&#xE4;xt&quot; i Serbien under perioden 2021-2022. Insatsens totala budget &#xE4;r 14 394 920 kronor varav 100% av budgeten kommer fr&#xE5;n Sida. Vidaref&#xF6;rmedling av medel ska inte f&#xF6;rekomma i projektet.

NALED &#xE4;r en oberoende icke-vinstdrivande och opolitisk f&#xF6;rening med &#xF6;ver 300 olika medlemmar i form av f&#xF6;retag, kommuner och olika civilsamh&#xE4;lles organisationer som arbetar tillsammans f&#xF6;r att skapa b&#xE4;ttre f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar f&#xF6;r att leva och arbeta i Serbien. NALED ing&#xE5;r &#xE4;ven i ett partnern&#xE4;tverk som involverar mer &#xE4;n 100 olika statliga institutioner och internationella organisationer och har en egen pool av experter som g&#xF6;r det m&#xF6;jligt f&#xF6;r organisationen att erbjuda kvalificerade program f&#xF6;r kapacitetsuppbyggnad och utbildningar till offentlig sektor i Serbien inom en rad omr&#xE5;den till en konkurrenskraftig kostnad. Sammantaget har NALED bed&#xF6;mts ha relevant teknisk kompetens och kapacitet att p&#xE5; ett effektivt s&#xE4;tt samarbeta med ett brett spektrum av akt&#xF6;rer f&#xF6;r att uppn&#xE5; relevanta och h&#xE5;llbara resultat. Eftersom de &#xE4;r en ny partner till Sida planeras dock en effektivitetsrevision genomf&#xF6;ras n&#xE5;gon g&#xE5;ng under den tid projektet p&#xE5;g&#xE5;r med huvudfokus p&#xE5; fr&#xE5;gor som avser intern styrning och kontroll.

Det f&#xF6;reslagna projektet &#xE4;r m&#xE5;ngfacetterat och involverar ett antal parallella kompletterande processer inom den serbiska EU n&#xE4;rmandeprocessen. Huvudinriktningen &#xE4;r reformer avseende en mer effektiv offentlig f&#xF6;rvaltning, minskad korruption och en anpassning till EU:s inre marknad genom f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade offentliga upphandlingar. 

Det f&#xF6;reslagna projektet inneh&#xE5;ller ett detaljerat resultatramverk och de f&#xF6;reslagna resultatomr&#xE5;dena har valts ut p&#xE5; grund av deras relevans och genomf&#xF6;rbarhet. Projektet inneh&#xE5;ller &#xE4;ven komponenter avseende bl a &#xF6;kad anv&#xE4;ndning av milj&#xF6;krav och sociala krav (inklusive j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet) i offentlig upphandling i Serbien samt &#xF6;kad anv&#xE4;ndning av kriteriet ekonomiskt mest f&#xF6;rdelaktigt anbud vid tilldelning av kontrakt vilket i sin tur f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till b&#xE4;ttre anv&#xE4;ndning av offentliga medel och en l&#xE5;ngsiktigt mera h&#xE5;llbar ekonomisk utveckling i landet.

Bidraget &#xE4;r relevant eftersom det f&#xF6;ljer nationellt fastst&#xE4;llda prioriteringar och &#xE4;r i linje med Serbiens och Sveriges strategiska m&#xE5;l. M&#xF6;jligheterna att n&#xE5; avsedda resultat &#xF6;kas genom en n&#xE4;ra koppling till planerade och p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende institutionella reformer inom den serbiska offentliga f&#xF6;rvaltningen inklusive en &#xF6;kad grad av digitalisering. 

Budgeten bed&#xF6;ms vara rimlig i f&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llande till m&#xE5;l och f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade resultat. Budgeten &#xE4;r uppdelad i tv&#xE5; delar: 1) Programf&#xF6;rvaltning och aktivitetskostnader och 2) Programdriftskostnader. Enligt revisionsrapporten f&#xF6;r 2019 uppgick NALED:s inkomst fr&#xE5;n olika bidrag till 133 394 miljoner dinarer (ungef&#xE4;r 12 MSEK) och det aktuella bidraget fr&#xE5;n Sida skulle d&#xE5; motsvara 39% av det totala beloppet f&#xF6;r 2021 respektive 36% f&#xF6;r 2022 under nuvarande f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar.

Det finns en tydlig uppdelning mellan avgifter och ers&#xE4;ttningsgilla kostnader och f&#xF6;rteckningar anv&#xE4;nds f&#xF6;r att koppla budgetposter med resultatomr&#xE5;den i resultatramverket. Sammantaget motsvarar programf&#xF6;rvaltningskostnader 26.9% av den totala budgeten. Kostnaderna f&#xF6;r konsultarvoden och aktiviteter uppg&#xE5;r till 64.7% den totala budgeten, vilket &#xE4;r rimligt i ett program av denna komplexitet. Programdriftskostnader uppg&#xE5;r till 8.9% av den totala budgeten och inkluderar kostnaderna f&#xF6;r hyran, telefon, kontorsmateriel, revision, bankkostnader och bokf&#xF6;ring. Det finns ingen &quot;overhead&quot; angiven i budgeten.

Riskerna f&#xF6;r effektiviteten och genomf&#xF6;rbarheten av projektet har bed&#xF6;mts, dokumenterats och sammanfattats i ett riskanalysregister. Riskerna har bed&#xF6;mts i f&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llande till de f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade resultat och h&#xE4;nsyn har tagits till principerna f&#xF6;r bist&#xE5;ndseffektivitet. De st&#xF6;rsta riskerna med detta projekt avser konsekvenser av Covid-19 pandemin f&#xF6;r aktiviteter, bristande politisk vilja f&#xF6;r faktisk implementering av reformer, otillr&#xE4;ckligt &#xE4;gande och oklara ansvarsomr&#xE5;den hos projektpartners (inklusive brist p&#xE5; personal) samt otillr&#xE4;cklig samordning med andra projekt och mellan olika akt&#xF6;rer involverade i projektet. Sammantaget bed&#xF6;ms en majoritet av identifierade risker som l&#xE5;g och l&#xE4;mpliga &#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder har identifierats f&#xF6;r att hantera dessa risker. Avtalade riskhanterings&#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder genomf&#xF6;rs inom den &#xF6;vergripande ramen f&#xF6;r uppf&#xF6;ljning samt genom dialog och formell rapportering.

Dialogfr&#xE5;gor har identifierats och de viktigaste fr&#xE5;gorna att f&#xF6;lja upp i dialogen kommer att vara f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rkning av systemet f&#xF6;r uppf&#xF6;ljning av signaler om oegentligheter, f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad intern &#xF6;vervakning och rapportering om genomf&#xF6;randet av interna f&#xF6;rvaltnings- och kontrollf&#xF6;rfaranden samt f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rkning av riskanalysprocessen inom organisationen. 

Sidas avtalsmall f&#xF6;r bidrag till icke-statliga organisationer kan anv&#xE4;ndas utan avvikelser.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NALED has submitted an application to Sida to support the implementation of the project &quot;Public Procurement for Economic Growth&quot; in Serbia during the period 2021-2022 in the amount of SEK 14,394,920. The total budget of the contribution is SEK 14,394,920 and 100% of the budget comes from Sida. There will be no forwarding of funds in the project.

NALED is an independent, non-profit and non-partisan association of more than 300 members, including businesses, local governments and civil society organizations, which work together on creating favorable conditions for living and working in Serbia. NALED is also a part of a partner network involving more than 100 state institutions and international organizations and it has its own pool of experts that enables which enables them to provide capacity building programs and trainings for public sector in Serbia in a number of areas at a competitive cost. Overall, NALED has been assessed to be in the possession of relevant technical expertise and capacity to effectively collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders to achieve relevant and sustainable results. However, since they are a new partner to Sida, an efficiency audit will be performed at one point during the implementation with a main focus on issues related to governance and internal control.

This is a multifaceted project that involves a number of parallel complementary processes within the broader EU integration agenda.&#xA0;The main focus is on reforms towards a more efficient public administration, reduced corruption and adaptation to the EU internal market through improved public procurement.

The proposed project contains a detailed results framework and the proposed result areas have been selected due to their relevance and feasibility. The project also includes components regarding, among other things, the increased use of environmental and social requirements (including gender equality) in public procurement in Serbia as well as the increased use of the most economically advantageous criterion in the award of contracts, which is expected to contribute to better use of public funds and long-term more sustainable economic development in the country.

The contribution is relevant, as it follows the nationally set priorities and is in line with Serbia&apos;s and Sweden&apos;s strategic goals. Opportunities to achieve intended results are increased through a close link with planned and ongoing institutional reforms in the Serbian public administration, including an increased level of digitization.

The budget is assessed to be reasonable in relation to expected results. The budget is divided into two parts: Program Management and Activity Costs and Program Operational Costs. According to the  2019 audit report, NALED&apos;s income from various contributions amounted to 133,394 million dinars (approximately SEK 12 million) and the current contribution from Sida would correspond to 39% of the total amount for 2021 and 36% for 2022 if observed under the same conditions.

There is a clear division between fees and reimbursables and indices are used to link budget items with results areas in the results framework. Program Management costs represent 26.9% of the total budget. The cost of consultancy fees and activities amount to 64.7% of the total budget, which is reasonable in a program of this complexity. Program Operational Costs amount to 8.9% of the total budget and include the cost of rent, telephone, office supplies, auditing, bank costs and accounting. There is no overhead cost in the budget.

The risks to the efficiency and feasibility of the project have been assessed, documented and summarized in a risk analysis register. The main risks of this project relate to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on activities, lack of political will for the actual implementation of reforms, insufficient ownership and unclear responsibilities of project partners (including lack of staff) and insufficient coordination with other projects and between various actors involved in the project. Overall, a majority of identified risks are considered to be low and appropriate measures have been identified to manage these risks. Agreed risk management measures will be implemented within the overall framework for follow-up and through dialogue and formal reporting.
 
Dialogue issues have been identified and the most important issues to follow up in the dialogue will be the strengthening of the system for following up on signals on irregularities, improved internal monitoring and reporting on the implementation of internal management and control procedures and strengthening the risk analysis process within the organization.

Sida&apos;s agreement template for grants to non-governmental organizations can be used without deviations.</narrative>

3) To contribute to decrease of corruption and irregularities in public procurement, as well as building trust in the public procurement system and
4) To contribute to Covid-19 recovery via more efficient public spending.
The overall objectives are expected to be reached by targeting the following specific objectives, structured as the three project components/result areas:
1) To contribute to improved implementation of the new Law on Public Procurement (legal and strategic framework) by strengthening the capacities of purchasers (institutions) and bidders (companies),
2) To improve the transparency and efficiency of the system for planning and monitoring of public procurement by improving and promoting the use of digital solutions,
3) To improve the oversight and enforcement of rights in public procurement and strengthen the role of civil society and general public.</narrative>

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has applied to Sida for funds of SEK 20 044 000 to carry out the &quot;COVID-19 Preparedness and Response in Southern and Horn of Africa Project&#x201D; over a period of six months,  July 2020 to January 2021. 

The intervention aims to contribute to a well-coordinated, informed, and timely response to COVID-19 in two Regional Economic Communities (RECs) of the African Union &#x2013; namely Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) -  in line with the Africa Joint Response to COVID-19, through mobility tracking systems and preparedness and response efforts to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

IOM is proposing to strengthen the support provided to Member States along the following 2 pillars of collaboration:
1) Information Management
2) Strengthened Member State Capacity 

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) will be the implementer of the project in collaboration with national governments of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique. 

The intervention&#x2019;s total budget is 20 044 000 SEK.

Disbursement of the total amount will be made upon signing of the agreement since the project has a duration of only six months and because of the emergency nature of the intervention.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
WHO AFRO has applied to Sweden for funding of 80 million SEK to carry out the &quot; Country Level AFRO Reform (DCL): From COVID to HEALTH), which is divided into two pillars. Pillar 1: COVID-19 implications on essential health service delivery (i.e., SRHR) and mitigating the risk of system collapse&quot; and pillar two &#x201C;Coordinated Strategic and Policy Support for Structural and Functional Transformation of WHO Country Offices.&#x201D; The programme will be implemented between 1 July 2020 and 31 December 2021. Sida will contribute 30 Million SEK to pillar one and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) will contribute 50 million SEK to pillar two. 

The funding will be used to strengthen and amplify the convening power, influence, and mandate of the WHO/AFRO to offer quality and timely technical support to the focus countries. More specifically, this Grant will allow WHO/AFRO to support the focus countries in achieving the following outcomes:

1. Maintained continuity of essential high-quality SRHR information and services through a health system approach, including preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence
2. Increased access to a wider range of contraceptive methods (expanded method mix) through Task Sharing and self-care interventions
3. Strengthened monitoring system for tracking progress in SRHR/Family Planning.

This investment will enable WHO-AFRO to contribute to components of its Transformation Agenda 2015-2020&#x2014;pro-results values, smart technical focus; responsive strategic operations; and effective communication and partnerships in the SRHR workspace. It will also contribute to the Regional WHO transformation aiming at understanding the country&#x2019;s priorities as well as the type and level of support required and align WHO country presence to the Member States and partner expectations (linked to Pillar II).

WHO AFRO will implement the contribution in close coronation with 2Gether4SRHR (ID: 10596), in particular the agreement amended (ZAM-DC19/2020). The total budget of the contribution is 80 Million SEK, where Sida contributes 30 MSEK and the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs 50 MSEK (Decision UD2020/08919/IU, UD2020/01985/FN) .

The contribution is in line with the Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Nya medel/medeltill&#xE4;gg f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
Konsekvenserna av covid-19 pandemin f&#xF6;r l&#xE5;g- och medelinkomstl&#xE4;nder riskerar bli katastrofala b&#xE5;de vad g&#xE4;ller h&#xE4;lsoutfall och f&#xF6;r den sociala och ekonomiska utvecklingen. I slutet av juni 2020 var antalet bekr&#xE4;ftade fall av covid-19, som orsakas av coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), drygt 8,8 miljoner och 465 000 personer har avlidit. Afrika har &#xE4;n s&#xE5; l&#xE4;nge relativt f&#xE5; fall, men WHO:s Regionkontor f&#xF6;r Afrika (AFRO) uppskattar att 22 procent av befolkningen p&#xE5; den afrikanska kontinenten kommer att smittas under pandemins f&#xF6;rsta &#xE5;r, vilket kan komma att resultera i 190 000 d&#xF6;dsfall. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) har nyligen publicerat en analys som visar att covid-19 Afrikas pandemi har haft samma utveckling under de f&#xF6;rsta 150 dagarna som de kontinenter som drabbats tidigare. 

Ut&#xF6;ver direkta h&#xE4;lsokonsekvenserna av covid-19 visar ett antal prognoser att krishanteringen kan komma att tr&#xE4;nga undan grundl&#xE4;ggande h&#xE4;lso- och sjukv&#xE5;rdsinsatser, inklusive sexuell och reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa och r&#xE4;ttigheter (SRHR). Dessutom riskerar covid-19 responsen att finansiera punktinsatser ist&#xE4;llet f&#xF6;r att beakta helhetsbehov och bygga motst&#xE5;ndskraftiga system f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra &#xE5;terh&#xE4;mtning. Erfarenhet fr&#xE5;n Ebola-epidemin visade att gravida kvinnors tillg&#xE5;ng till m&#xF6;drah&#xE4;lsov&#xE5;rd minskade med f&#xF6;rh&#xF6;jd m&#xF6;drad&#xF6;dlighet som konsekvens. Tidiga uppgifter fr&#xE5;n covid-19 drabbade l&#xE4;nder i regionen visar till exempel en &#xF6;kning med 30% i antalet &#xE4;renden om k&#xF6;nsrelaterat v&#xE5;ld. Nyckelgrupper &#xE4;r s&#xE4;rskilt s&#xE5;rbara p&#xE5; grund av minskat f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning, stigma och diskriminering. Sida ser d&#xE4;rmed en stor risk resultaten i Sveriges regionala SRHR strategi riskerar att p&#xE5;verkas negativt, vilket f&#xF6;ranlett behovet av att st&#xF6;dja den kontinentala covid-19 responsen, med fokus p&#xE5; de indirekta effekterna av pandemin p&#xE5; SRHR.

Den 22 februari 2020 h&#xF6;lls ett krism&#xF6;te med alla Afrikas 55 h&#xE4;lsoministrar/ h&#xE4;lsoministerier vilket resulterade i en kontinental strategi mot covid-19. Sydafrikas president, i egenskap av ordf&#xF6;rande f&#xF6;r Afrikanska Unionen, godk&#xE4;nde strategin tillsammans med den byr&#xE5; som bist&#xE5;r ordf&#xF6;randen, f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande presidenterna fr&#xE5;n Mali, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Egypten och Kenya. Den kontinentala covid-19 strategin Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak har tv&#xE5; &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;l: 1) att f&#xF6;rebygga sv&#xE5;r sjukdom och d&#xF6;d av coronavirusinfektion i medlemsl&#xE4;nder och 2) att minimera sociala och ekonomiska konsekvenser av covid-19 utbrottet

M&#xE5;ls&#xE4;ttningarna ska uppn&#xE5;s via tv&#xE5; huvudsakliga arbetssp&#xE5;r: att samordna covid-19 responsen mellan medlemsl&#xE4;nder, AU:s organ och WHO, och andra partners f&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla synergier och att minska risker f&#xF6;r dubbelarbete samt genom att fr&#xE4;mja evidensbaserade folkh&#xE4;lsostrategier f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning (surveillance), f&#xF6;rebyggande arbete, diagnos, behandling och kontroll av covid-19.

Strategin implementeras genom Africa Task Force for Coronavirus (AFTCOR), d&#xE4;r Africa CDC, FN och AU:s medlemsl&#xE4;nder leder arbetsgrupper, och genom Africa CDC&#x2019;s Incident Management System (IMS). Ett antal partners, b&#xE5;de FN och ickestatliga akt&#xF6;rer, bidrar ocks&#xE5; till att implementera strategin. Dessa implementerande partners finansieras antingen direkt av bist&#xE5;ndsgivare som finansierar kompletterande
insatser, eller via Africa CDC som sedan vidaref&#xF6;rmedlar medel till implementerande partners. Ett till&#xE4;gg finns &#xE4;ven till strategin, AU COVID-19 Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan Addendum to the African Union COVID-19- Continental Strategy, som inkluderar specifik referens till att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla tillg&#xE5;ng till grundl&#xE4;ggande h&#xE4;lsosjukv&#xE5;rd, inklusive m&#xF6;drabarnh&#xE4;lsov&#xE5;rd under covid-19 pandemin.

Sida kommer att bidra till Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak genom tv&#xE5; nya insatser och en avtals&#xE4;ndring av en p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende insats, 2Gether4SRHR (insats ID: 10596, beslutsnummer ZAM-DC19/2020). De tv&#xE5; nya insatserna &#xE4;r till Africa CDC om SEK 20 000 000 och till WHO AFRO om SEK 30 000 000. Sida ser p&#xE5; insatserna som tre delar av ett sammanh&#xE5;llet st&#xF6;d i linje med ovan n&#xE4;mnda strategi, dvs Africa Joint Continental Strategy for COVID-19 Outbreak.

WHO AFRO har s&#xF6;kt om finansiering f&#xF6;r programmet Country Level AFRO Reform (DCL): From COVID to HEALTH (2020&#x2013;2021), som &#xE4;r uppdelat p&#xE5; tv&#xE5; pelare. Pelare ett: COVID-19 implications on essential health service delivery (i.e., SRHR) and mitigating the risk of system collapse och pelare tv&#xE5;: Coordinated Strategic and Policy Support for Structural and Functional Transformation of WHO Country Offices under perioden 1 juli 2020 till 31 december 2021. Sida kommer att finanserna pelare ett med 30 miljoner SEK och UD finansiera pelare tv&#xE5; med 50 Miljoner SEK (Beslut UD2020/08919/IU, UD2020/01985/FN). Den totala volymen &#xE4;r 80 miljoner SEK. Insatsen finansieras via en s.k. pooled fund som administreras av WHO AFRO, som &#xE4;r avtalspart. Aktiviteterna under pelare ett kommer att genomf&#xF6;ras inom WHO AFRO regionen, med f&#xF6;ljande fokusl&#xE4;nder: Sierra Leone, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Kamerun, Nigeria, Centralafrikanska Republiken och Demokratiska Republiken Kongo och genom st&#xE4;rkt kapacitet f&#xF6;r samordning p&#xE5; det WHO:s regionala kontor f&#xF6;r AFRO-regionen i Brazzaville.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC&apos;s Humanitarian Programme 2021-2025</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NRC is Norway&#x2019;s largest international humanitarian organisation and widely recognised as a leading field-based displacement agency within the international humanitarian community. NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

NRC is the INGO receiving the largest contribution from Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit to INGOs so far, based on experience of successful partnerships, NRC&apos;s capacities to respond at scale and its coverage of crises that Sida is prioritizing through the needs-based allocation approach. NRC receives approximately 8% of Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit&apos;s annual budget appropriation which is substantial.
The objectives of NRC for 2021 can be summarized as follows: &quot;To protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors.&quot; It is expected, for 2021, that NRC will reach out approximately 7.26 million beneficiaries within the proposed country programme portfolio selected by Sida, to which the share of Sida will amount to around 8% according to its contribution in proportion to the total budget. In 2019, NRC reached globally 9.1 million persons in 33 crisis settings.
NRC&#x2019;s work is divided into three pillars: humanitarian assistance, advocacy and expert deployment.&#xA0;Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit funding will continue prioritizing mainly the first pillar through funding of the humanitarian country programmes in line with HRPs and the RRPs and through the RRM funding. To some extent, Sida will support as well the second pillar of advocacy which is integrated in the humanitarian country programmes and implemented by NRC&apos;s method, thematic and capacity development projects supported by Sida. Sida will provide NRC with only a punctual support to the third pillar, through funding to CashCap which is deploying experts to the field for invigorating cash assistance working groups (17 in 2020 to 16 countries).
More specifically, NRC will be supported for implementing humanitarian programmes in its respective areas of expertise in the settings that Sida and NRC have agreed upon to prioritize through this contribution: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, (plus Ecuador and Panama), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras/El Salvador/Mexico, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen and Other. There are the largest refugee and internal displacement crises and cumulate around three quarters of the current global displacement caseload. These programmes will continue to be supported by Sida along the PBA regime of partnership initiated in 2016 and extended since then.
As an indication, NRC distributed its total resources in 2019 within its core competencies as follows:&#xA0;26% for Shelter and settlements,&#xA0;20% for&#xA0; Education,&#xA0;17% for Livelihoods and Food Security,&#xA0;14% for ICLA,&#xA0;9% for WASH,&#xA0;3% for Camp Management and&#xA0;11% for Other. In 2021, NRC foresees to distribute its resources as follows: 21% for Education, 19% for Shelter and settlements, 19% for Livelihoods, 15% for ICLA, 12% for WaSH, 2% for Camp management, 1% for Advocacy. The COVID-19 socioeconomic impacts on displaced populations are partly motivating the increase in Education, Livelihoods, ICLA and WaSH.
The good scores of NRC in ITAD&apos;s evaluation confirms for Sida that NRC is meeting its objectives and delivers quality humanitarian assistance and services, as expected.
Describing NRC&apos;s activities within its core competencies would fill volumes. It is proposed here to provide few examples from field visit observations made between 2014 and 2020 in the Great Lakes and in the Levant that tell about NRC&apos;s work.&#xA0;
SHELTER: NRC may provide cash assistance, construction material, mobilize the community to build shelters for the most vulnerable unable to build them on their own, prevent evictions. In Lebanon, NRC identified very vulnerable and homeless refugee households, or about to be expelled by their landlords for not paying their rent due to poverty. NRC found unfinished housing constructions in the neighbourhood. NRC proposed to the owners to gradually finish the construction work of flats at NRC&apos;s expense but in exchange to accept to accommodate for free the vulnerable families for a year. The family would find shelter and a financial relief beneficial for the whole family as it would not have to pay for the rent, while the landlord would end up with an upgraded building. More interestingly, the refugee household would be identified in the neighborhood as a positive factor upgrading local housing standards, not down-grading the neighborhood socially. NRC documented that the protection of the household was improving ultimately, thanks to local social integration.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Facilitating access to shelter during emergency, as well as in&#xA0;protracted displacement situations.
LIVELIHOODS: NRC masters cash assistance, to the point that it is used as an expert for helping other organizations to programme such interventions and for monitoring the outcomes of UN cash assistance systems on behalf of donors (CAMELEON/Lebanon). In Bukavu (DRC), NRC created a vocational school that was handed over to the Governorate for training IDP youth and host community youth in developing different technical skills, including construction, IT, etc. that made them employeable on the labour market and enabled them to generate income. That was a contribution to reduce dependency on aid, prevent criminality and violence, enhance social cohesion and at the same time preparing the way for durable solutions to displacement situation. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of food assistance to prevent loss of life&#xA0;and contribution to rehabilitation of local food and market systems to strenghten&#xA0;livelihoods and individuals&apos; and households&apos; abilities to earn a living.
ICLA: NRC is at its best in programmes where it helps refugees and IDPs to recreate the civil documentation that they have lost because of or during displacements. Lost documents may be birth certificates, property documents, certificates of marriage, heritage entitlements, diplomas, etc. Their absence exposes to violations, exploitation and abuse those who are deprived of such documents. Civil documentation, as observed in Jordan, is central for claiming one&apos;s rights, accessing services and preparing for the future. NRC assesses with individuals and families what is missing, advises how to access basic services and provides legal support to get back or replace documents, often across the border, with local lawyers. Syrian refugees would keep the ownership of properties that might have been confiscated if they were not claiming their rights on them timely thanks to NRC with valid property documents. Advising on divorce procedures, supporting women to claim their rights while separating from men they had been married to in early marriage arrangements, was a significant work of NRC&apos;s lawyers.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to people to claim&#xA0;and exercise their rights through information, counselling, legal assistance, collaborative&#xA0;dispute resolution, capacity building and advocacy to ensure access to legal identity&#xA0;documentation, housing land and property rights, employment rights and knowledge&#xA0;around migration laws. Specific assistance to women and children as they may face&#xA0;particular obstacles in accessing their rights.
EDUCATION: Children and youth lose years of education due to displacement. NRC works for reintegrating students in schools by helping them catching up lost grades faster. NRC has been training teachers and school personnel in Burundi to absorb the additional numbers of returnee youth who were Burundian refugees born in Tanzania that are enrolling in ill-prepared Burundian schools, at the best interest of the students, including protection aspects. Students had to be assisted for shifting overnight from Kiswahili and English-language curriculas to Kirundi and French-language curriculas. By doing that NRC, not only restaures education rights, but contributes to the local social cohesion. NRC is involved in the global Education Cannot Wait through advocacy.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Support to children and youth to complete a full cycle of basic education&#xA0;with particular focus on those who are out of school or have had their education&#xA0;interrupted. Provision of technical and vocational training for young adults.
CAMP MANAGEMENT: NRC showed further its protection work to Sida in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps in Jordan, designed for accommodating social cases, un-documented individuals and alleged security threats, including un-accompanied minors, who could not be left free in the society according to the authorities. NRC would turn the experience of detention, in the middle of nowhere, desertic in fact, less depressing by upgrading shelter conditions, and providing education services, vocational training and psychosocial support, including assisting refugees to negotiate temporary exit permits. NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Camp management, in and outside of camp settings. Camp&#xA0;management core functions include coordinating and monitoring assistance and&#xA0;protection, setting up and supporting governance and community participation&#xA0;mechanisms, managing and disseminating information, providing multisector feedback&#xA0;mechanisms, and maintaining infrastructure.
WASH: Five year into their displacement situation, Syrian refugees in Lebanon were still provided with 15 L/person/day drinkable water through costly water-trucking deliveries serving around 285,000 people living in thousands of informal tented settlements (ITS) of the Bekaa valley. Central authorities were blocking any improvements, like drilling wells, that would result in permanenting the refugee settlements in the country or giving the refugees the hope that they have a future in Lebanon. NRC managed to negotiate with communal councils, eager to improve their own infrastructures needing maintainance since the Civil War, that certain settlements along main roads would be connected to the local water systems.&#xA0;NRC presents its works in this sector as follows:&#xA0;Provision of infrastructre for&#xA0;water and sanitation, and information dissemination on good hygiene practices.
Sida has evidence that NRC is aligning fully its own response strategies on the HRPs, which is a condition for receiving Sida&apos;s funding. NRC is usually an active stakeholder of the process of elaborating such plans, inter alia through its engagement in participating in or co-leading clusters of the local humanitarian system (potentially in its core competencies sectors) depending on locations, and through hosting NGO coordination forums.&#xA0;
RRM Allocation 2021
Included in this contribution, it is proposed to support NRC&apos;s capacity to address new emerging humanitarian needs in rapid onset crises. Sida&apos;s funding Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) allocation to NRC will enable NRC to react very fast to new disasters when they strike. It may provide seed funding to larger response programmes and catalyze more resources, complementing as well the resources that the flexibility of PBA provides for re-allocating them in such circumstances, when possible. In 2020, NRC tapped into its 50 MSEK allocation 15 times, replenished once, until it was exhausted, intervening in 13 countries where NRC had presence in the context of sudden displacement situations, floods, droughts and socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 on displaced and vulnerable households. The assistance provided consisted generally in protection services and assistance delivered in form of cash, vouchers, and in-kind life-saving commodities, in the areas of shelter, basic assistance kits, hygiene promotion and psychosocial support. In 2021, NRC will undertake similar interventions with the RRM allocation with an initial 40 MSEK funding from Sida. RRM interventions are considered as projects, implemented over a 3 to 6 month period, with a 3 MSEK budget in average. The ceiling is 5 MSEK, while the bottom budget is 2 MSEK, but exceptions can be justified case by case.
Method- and capacity-building projects
Included in this contribution, NRC has proposed to Sida to support Method- and capacity-building projects that will contribute to improve the global humanitarian system and coordination &amp;amp; advocacy forums at the national level.
- Strengthening global protection policy for displacement communities is a project that Sida is willing to prioritize as it&#xA0;focuses on ensuring effective integration of protection across NRC programming and improvements to global humanitarian protection policy by translating concepts into concrete actionable outcomes. This project aims at ensuring that protection is foundational to all NRC work through the &#x2018;Safe Programming&#x2019; framework defining minimum commitments for NRC&apos;s operations, and at supporting the full realisation of the right of freedom of movement in safety and dignity for displacement-affected persons, in programmes for the protection of civilians, for durable solutions and for migrants in &apos;refugee-like&apos; situations.
- Becoming the leading displacement organization in hard to reach areas (H2R) is a project that will be supported in 2021 by Sida. It addresses the growing complexity of operating environments by investing in in-depth understanding of contexts against the backdrop of shifting international norms and the rise of new tech solutions to ensure timely and appropriate responses. NRC wants to&#xA0;ensure that displacement-affected individuals considered hard-to-reach have better access to assistance and protection, by enhancing NRC&apos;s ability to access multiple geographical and cultural H2R contexts, by delivering high quality and sustained programming in H2R areas and by advocating for the rights of people affected by displacement in H2R areas.
- Sida&apos;s support to NRC&apos;s CashCap will be continued in 2021. The project ensures that humanitarian/development agencies and national actors have sufficient and sustained expertise to design and implement cash and market-based response (CMBR) in an effective and coordinated manner. NRC intends to ensure global rapid deployment capacity for the initial days of a sudden onset emergency and to enable the systematic consideration of cash and voucher assistance as part of the initial response analysis. NRC will facilitate knowledge exchange, provide technical backstop and support to CashCap roster members on deployment, and improve sustainability between CashCap expert and cash community by sharing information, promoting continuity and encouraging to take ownership by the cash community.
-&#xA0;NRC&#x2019;s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva will continue to be co-financed by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit and Sida&apos;s unit for Global Cooperation on Environment in 2021. IDMC is a global leader in monitoring, reporting on and advocating for people displaced within their own country. It is known for its research publications and advocacy aiming at&#xA0;generating evidence on all situations of internal displacement; building capacity to prevent and respond to the issue; and galvanising political commitment and action to drive positive change. For the second and probably last year, Sida&apos;s Unit for Global Cooperation on Environment will co-finance IDMC in 2021 together with the Humanitarian Unit, as IDMC analyzes displacement situation trends caused by climate change as well. IDMC adds great value to the evidence- and needs-based mobilization of resources for displacement situations. Its analysis and research are major contributions to the global and local advocacy agenda.
- NRC will be supported as well through this contribution for hosting local humanitarian coordination platforms where international and local NGOs cooperate for building up coordinated programmes, common advocacy agendas and for influencing the policy-making of authorities, the UN, donors and other partners. These forums play a key role in localizing the response, offering coordination services, training and partnership opportunities to the local NGO community. They play as well an important role for INGOs in addressing administrative and access obstacles that they may face with authorities for establishing themselves and obtaining visas and work permits. The Jordan INGO Forum and the Libya INGO Forum will be supported through this contribution.&#xA0;NRC&apos;s active engagement in the local NGO forums, sometimes by hosting them with Sida&apos;s support (DRC, Palestine (AIDA), Jordan, Libya, Lebanon until (2019)), demonstrates NRC&apos;s commitment to aid effectiveness and collective action regarding humanitarian coordination and advocacy.
- Furthermore, it is proposed to continue co-financing for a last year the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) with the Swedish General Consulate in Jerusalem and other donors. It is a strategic partnership between DG ECHO, 10 European States and 5 INGOs providing protection and assistance to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank due to recurrent violations of international law. The project addresses the protection needs of persons and communities of concern through a multi-sector approach that reduces vulnerabilities, builds capacities and responds to threats. The Consulate has established a 3 year partnership 2021-2023 with NRC (#14571, 39 MSEK) for that project. The WBPC project, and the NGO platform AIDA, supported so far by Sida&apos;s humanitarian unit, will be funded by Sweden&apos;s development cooperation strategy for Palestine, integrated in that contribution.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Norwegian Refugee Council - Norska flyktingr&#xE5;det (NRC) - har ans&#xF6;kt om ett f&#xF6;rnyat partnerskap med Sida 2021-2025. NRC har dessutom ans&#xF6;kt om finansiering p&#xE5; 364,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra humanit&#xE4;ra insatser i 26 humanit&#xE4;ra krisomr&#xE5;den under 2021: Afghanistan, Kamerun, Centralafrikanska republiken, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Eritrea, Etiopien, Iran, Irak, Jordanien, Kenya, Libanon, Libyen, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexiko, Palestina, Somalia, Sydsudan, Sudan, Tanzania / Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela och Jemen. Ans&#xF6;kan inkluderar &#xE4;ven 40 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r den humanit&#xE4;ra snabbmekanismen (RRM) och 20 miljoner kronor i st&#xF6;d till sju projekt f&#xF6;r metodst&#xF6;d, kapacitetsuppbyggnad och samordning.

NRC:s m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att i krissituationer skydda f&#xF6;rdrivna och utsatta m&#xE4;nniskor, v&#xE4;rna deras r&#xE4;ttigheter och bist&#xE5; med assistans f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta deras omedelbara humanit&#xE4;ra behov, f&#xF6;rhindra ytterligare f&#xF6;rdrivning, samt bidra till h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar. Dessutom tillhandah&#xE5;ller NRC expertis som en strategisk partner f&#xF6;r det humanit&#xE4;ra systemet och dess olika akt&#xF6;rer. NRC bedriver ocks&#xE5; principbaserat  och tydligt p&#xE5;verkanarbete f&#xF6;r att ut&#xF6;va  inflytande p&#xE5; beslutsfattare. NRC planerar att under 2021 bist&#xE5; 7,263,000 personer med humanit&#xE4;ra behov.  

NRC bygger sina program med m&#xE4;nniskor i centrum, och med s&#xE4;rskild inriktning p&#xE5; personer som har tvingats p&#xE5; flykt. Det &#xE4;r en r&#xE4;ttighetsbaserad organisation som verkar f&#xF6;r att ge skydd &#xE5;t de mest utsatta och s&#xE5;rbara och hj&#xE4;lpa dem att &#xE5;teruppbygga sina liv. NRC arbetar d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r alltid f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar n&#xE4;r de genomf&#xF6;r humanit&#xE4;ra projekt och program. Organisationen integrerar &#xE4;ven humanit&#xE4;r medling och f&#xF6;rhandling mellan olika parter i samh&#xE4;llet i sina program och p&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt kan organisationen &#xE4;ven bidra till en fredliga l&#xF6;sningar p&#xE5; l&#xE5;nvariga konflikter. NRC:s programmering st&#xE4;var efter att st&#xE4;rka kopplingar mellan humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd, utveckling och fred.

NRC kommer i huvudsak att genomf&#xF6;ra insatsen p&#xE5; egen hand, genom organisationens 7 700 anst&#xE4;llda och 7 000 volont&#xE4;rer som mobilisera i de omr&#xE5;dena d&#xE4;r insatsen genomf&#xF6;rs. 

Den aktuella budgeten f&#xF6;r NRC:s hela humanit&#xE4;ra program 2021 uppg&#xE5;r till 4 263 200 000 NOK, varav Sidas del f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande utg&#xF6;r ca 8%. Givare, som det norska utrikesministeriet, GD ECHO, UNHCR, etc. bidrar med st&#xF6;rre volymer och ytterligare ett tiotal andra givare har ing&#xE5;tt avtal med NRC. Sida ger NRC m&#xF6;jligheten att nyttja resurser flexibelt inom varje enskilt landprogram, (enligt  s&#xE5; kallad Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA)

Humanit&#xE4;r-Utveckling-Fred Nexus
NRC bidrar i h&#xF6;g grad till arbetet f&#xF6;r att sammankoppla humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd med freds- och utvecklingsinsatser. Organisationens  str&#xE4;van att effektivisera bist&#xE5;ndet genom katalytiskt st&#xF6;d till samordning och kapacitetsbyggande insatser bidrar till denna ansats. I samarbetet med andra organisationer m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r och bidrar NRC:s verksamhet och p&#xE5;verkansarbete till att st&#xE4;rka h&#xE5;llbara l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r flyktingar och m&#xE4;nniskor som har blivit tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rdrivna och bidrar d&#xE4;rmed till att p&#xE5; sikt minska de humanit&#xE4;ra behoven. &#xC4;ven krisdrabbade m&#xE4;nniskors m&#xF6;jligheter till sj&#xE4;lvf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning prioriteras. NRC:s analyskapacitet &#xE4;r en styrka som bidrar till att programmeringen anpassas till en nexus-ansats och den analys som genomf&#xF6;rs av NRC:s internationella center f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vervakning av tv&#xE5;ngsf&#xF6;rflyttning (IDMC) &#xE4;r av stor vikt f&#xF6;r dessa analyser. 15 av de 26 kriser i NRC:s portf&#xF6;lj som Sida finansierar avser l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sverige &#xE4;ven bedriver  utvecklingssamarbete vilket &#xF6;ppnar f&#xF6;r m&#xF6;jligheter till synergier med humanit&#xE4;rt bist&#xE5;nd.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has applied for a renewed strategic partnership with Sida during 2021-2025. NRC has applied as well to Sida for funding of 364.5 million SEK to carry out &#x201C;the Humanitarian Programme for 2021&#x201D; in 26 humanitarian crisis settings: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, Palestine,  Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania/Burundi, Uganda, Venezuela, Yemen. The application includes provision of 40 million SEK to replenish the Rapid Response Mechanism funding instrument and 7 individual projects for method, capacity-building and coordination.

The objectives of NRC&#x2019;s intervention is to protect the rights of displaced and vulnerable people during crisis, to provide assistance meeting their immediate humanitarian needs, to prevent further displacement and to contribute to durable solutions, and to provide expertise as a strategic partner to humanitarian systems and actors. NRC&apos;s principled and clear advocacy has the potential to influence positively decision-makers and duty-bearers. NRC is planning to assist around 7,263,000 persons in 2021.

NRC builds its programmes with people in the centre, in particular the displaced persons. As a rights-based organization, it delivers assistance with the aim to protect the most vulnerable from harm and to help them rebuild their lives. NRC always prepares therefore for durable solutions in delivering humanitarian assistance. NRC even integrates humanitarian mediation in its programmes at the community level wherever it can contribute to the peaceful solution to conflicts. NRC&apos;s programming follows obviously the triple humanitarian-development-peace nexus.

NRC will implement the intervention mainly by itself, through its 7,700 staff members and 7,000 volunteers mobilized within the affected communities. 

The intervention&#x2019;s tentative total budget is 4 263 200 000 Norwegian krona (NOK), that the organisation is financing with Sida&#x2019;s funding in a proportion of 8% approximately. Other donors, like the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DG ECHO, UNHCR,  etc. are the largest contributors, besides a dozen of other donors in agreement with NRC. Sida provides NRC with the opportunity to allocate resources flexibly within individual country programmes (Programme-Based Approach &#x2013; PBA).

Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus
NRC&apos;s catalytic support for coordination and capacity building contributes greatly to the link between humanitarian aid, development and peace. NRC&apos;s advocacy work and activities enable, at least contribute to, sustainable solutions for refugees and displaced people in a significant way in cooperation with other actors. In the long run, the NRC will reduce humanitarian needs. The NRC prioritizes self-sufficiency in its programs. The NRC&apos;s analysis capability, not least through its Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC), is an advantage for relevant programming according to the nexus orientations. Among the 26 crises in NRC&apos;s portfolio that Sida prioritizes, there are 15 where Sida implements Sweden&apos;s development strategies in synergy with humanitarian aid.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. The organisation&apos;s goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide.

FAO works side by side with the other two Rome-based UN agencies &#x2013; the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to promote food security by alleviating hunger through emergency food assistance as well as more long-term support to eliminate the root causes of food insecurity. While WFP&#x2019;s main comparative advantage lies in its capacity for large-scale food response, logistics, telecommunications and procurement capacity, the advantage of FAO lies in its role as the world&#x2019;s agricultural knowledge agency with its unique agricultural expertise but also in its holistic approach to humanitarian crises, which includes analysis of the entire food system, including cultivation, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing and consumption.

FAO also plays an important normative role, through international agreements, codes of conduct, and voluntary guidelines as well as policy dialogue at global, regional and national levels and advocacy in areas relevant to FAO&#x2019;s mandate.

Alignment with strategy

The objectives of FAO are in line with the strategy for Sweden&apos;s Humanitarian Assistance through Sida (2021-2025) and through its operations, FAO is strengthening the capacity and effectiveness of the humanitarian system. The contribution is relevant for all objectives in the strategy, with an emphasis on the strategy area on protection and assistance to crisis affected populations.

This is an appraisal and subsequent decision of a new contribution (Decision on Contribution, Rule for Managing Contributions 2.9 &#xA7;) between Sida and FAO, to allow for humanitarian response in four crises for 2021.

This decision also includes support for rapid response to new and deteriorating humanitarian crises through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) and Method-Development support through the Global Food Security Cluster.

This decision concerns a financial contribution to FAO amounting to 102 000 000 SEK.

Reasons for the decision

Evaluation 2020

During 2020, the humanitarian assistance unit at Sida conducted an overview of ongoing strategic partnerships in order to ensure that partnership was established with the most relevant and effective humanitarian actors to carry out Sweden&#x2019;s strategy for humanitarian assistance through Sida (2021 &#x2013; 2025). As a result of the overview, Sida has decided to appraise a new contribution and enter into a new strategic partnership agreement with FAO, see decision 2021-000057.

Comparative Advantage of FAO:

Based on the organisation&#x2019;s mandate to build a world without hunger through technical cooperation and assistance, FAO has a unique role to play in humanitarian settings. Through its long-standing country presence, technical expertise in agriculture and food systems, as well as expertise and experience in both humanitarian assistance and development cooperation, FAO is well-placed to address both acute hunger as well as to support countries experiencing food crises to return to normality and building resilience to future chocks. By protecting livelihoods through emergency agricultural assistance, FAO is hence able to provide emergency interventions that save lives and safeguard livelihoods in the short-term while at the same time strengthening resilience in the face of future crises.

FAO&#x2019;s comparative advantages were also highlighted by Sida&#x2019;s evaluation of its strategic partners, which stated that FAO, apart from being a strong player within the thematic areas of food security and livelihoods, also demonstrated strong capacity regarding resilience and nexus programming. The evaluation also concluded that FAO has a comparative advantage in its utilisation of partnerships with local actors and development agencies, which not only ensure sustainability of its interventions but also in many cases means that FAO has good indirect access in remote and hard to reach areas. Finally, the evaluation also recognised FAO&#x2019;s technical expertise as a valuable comparative advantage and highlighted FAO&#x2019;s participation in technical working groups and its leadership role in the food security clusters as well as its contribution to HNO/HRP processes. Specifically, the evaluation highlighted the Sida supported FSNAU intervention as an example of an FAO intervention that was instrumental in providing early warning to the humanitarian system in Somalia, which contributed to avert famine during the severe drought in 2017.

Sida&#x2019;s Humanitarian Follow Up and Field Missions to FAO Responses:

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the staff at Sida&#x2019;s unit for humanitarian assistance based in Stockholm were not able to make as many field follow-ups as per normal. Humanitarian focal points stationed in the Foreign Missions have been crucial to conduct follow-up, as well as digital tools that have allowed for remote monitoring and follow-up. Overall, the conclusions of continuous dialogue, monitoring and follow-up show that FAO is a professional humanitarian actor which, through its extensive network of partners, has the ability to gain access to very remote and hard to reach areas. Sida also notes that FAO in several contexts through its vast technical expertise, plays an important role in technical working groups and coordination fora in the project countries.

THE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 2021

According to the Global Humanitarian Overview, in 2021, 235 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance and protection &#x2013; a substantial increase compared to 2020 which started out with nearly 168 million people in need. Thus resulting in yet another year with the highest number of people in need ever recorded by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In parallel with staggering numbers of people in need, the funding gap increases and according to OCHA&#x2019;s Financial Tracking Service (FTS), response plans and appeals were only 46% funded in 2020, compared to 61% in 2019. In 2021 the UN and partner organisations aim to help 160 million people most in need across 56 countries, with an estimated requirement of 35 billion USD.

Both the increase in people in need and funding gap can be partly derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Putting additional pressure onto an already strained humanitarian system with limited resources. Although COVID-19 has definitely been centre stage during 2020, there are still other worrying trends affecting the global humanitarian outlook for 2021.

First, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the vulnerability of the least protected populations. The pandemic has triggered the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Extreme poverty has risen for the first time in 22 years, and unemployment has increased dramatically. The impact of the socio-economic situation will continue to have serious implications on humanitarian needs in 2021.

Second, political conflicts are more intense and are taking a heavy toll on civilians, disproportionally affecting children. Women and girls are at increased risk of conflict-related sexual violence. As such, protecting those affected by armed conflict is more crucial than ever. The lack of respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) continues to be one of the most pressing challenges. Armed conflicts continue to cause enormous suffering, including violations of IHL, such as killings, torture, abductions and displacements. Applying a protection lens/Centrality of Protection approach is essential &#x2013; in light of the protection crises such as the Syria crisis - now active for more than a decade; Yemen - being the largest humanitarian crisis worldwide; the DR Congo; the Venezuela crisis; the Nagorno-Karabach situation and the Rohingya crisis &#x2013; just to mention a few.

Third, hunger is on the rise, with conflict the main driver of acute hunger for 77 million people in 22 countries. By the end of 2020, the number of acutely food insecure people could be 270 million. The impacts of the pandemic and climate change are seriously affecting food systems worldwide.

Fourth, climate change exacerbate humanitarian needs and extreme weather events. The desert locust outbreak from late 2019 was the worst in 25 years in the Horn of Africa.  A series of flooding situations have taken place in 2020 where we have seen increased humanitarian needs and the displacement of vulnerable populations in contexts such as Sahel, South-East Asia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and South Sudan.   

Fifth, as a result of the above, displacements are at record high levels. Conflict, violence and natural disasters drive people to seek refuge in either their country of origin or by crossing international borders. The majority of the 80 million people living in displacement have been forced to seek refuge due to natural disasters. The number of refugees, most of which seek refuge in neighbouring countries, has doubled from 10 million to 20 million in 10 years.

Sida&#x2019;s humanitarian allocation to FAO in 2021

Sida&#xB4;s humanitarian assistance is based on the four humanitarian principles, in particular impartiality, with its compelling urge to ensure that humanitarian action is carried out based on needs alone, giving priority to the most urgent cases of distress. Hence, Sida&#x2019;s allocation methodology is grounded in several objective indicators such as; the scale of humanitarian needs (number of people in need), the severity of humanitarian needs (including food insecurity/IPC levels), the number of people targeted for the humanitarian response, the financial coverage of the respective humanitarian appeal, national capacities to respond and underlying risks, as well as distinct indicators related to forgotten crises. The allocation and subsequent disbursement of funds takes place in the beginning of the year to ensure predictability for Sida&#x2019;s strategic humanitarian partners and to allow for optimal operational planning.

Based on Sida&apos;s humanitarian needs-based allocation process in late 2020 the following is proposed for FAO in 2021:

- Annual Projects/Programmes in line with Humanitarian Response Plans (usually 12 months) - 67 000 000 SEK
- Rapid Response Mechanism (SFERA) - 25 000 000 SEK
- Method Development and Capacity-Building - 2 000 000 SEK

This means that the total initial contribution to FAO in 2021 amounts to 94 000 000 SEK.

Annual Projects/Programmes (in line with the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plans):

- Afghanistan: 30 000 000 SEK

- Nigeria: 9 000 000 SEK

- Somalia: 12 000 000 SEK

- Somalia (FSNAU): 4 000 000 SEK

- South Sudan: 12 000 000 SEK

Rapid Response Mechanism or unallocated funds:

- SFERA: 25 000 000 SEK

Method- and capacity-building support

- Global Food Security Cluster: 2 000 000 SEK</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAO&#x2019;s Global Goals are:
1. Eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times have sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life;
2. Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods;
3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.
Based on the global goals, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives:
1. Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition
2. Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable
3. Reduce rural poverty
4. Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems
5. Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises
The Strategic Framework also includes a sixth, broad objective on technical quality, knowledge and services (including cross-cutting themes) that is designed to cover FAO&#x2019;s internal capability to deliver its strategic objectives. The objectives are in alignment with FAO&#x2019;s commitment to working in partnerships.
In humanitarian crises, FAO&#x2019;s main components are:
To help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.
The humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):
OO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;
OO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.
At the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:
Output 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.
Output 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.
Output 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).
Output 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.
As Sida support FAO&#x2019;s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida&#x2019;s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.</narrative>

Reasons for the decision

Evaluation 2020

During 2020, the humanitarian assistance unit at Sida conducted an overview of ongoing strategic partnerships in order to ensure that partnership was established with the most relevant and effective humanitarian actors to carry out Sweden&#x2019;s strategy for humanitarian assistance through Sida (2021 &#x2013; 2025).

Through its long-standing country presence, technical expertise in agriculture and food systems, as well as expertise and experience in both humanitarian assistance and development cooperation, FAO is well-placed to address both acute hunger as well as to support countries experiencing food crises to return to normality and building resilience to future chocks. By protecting livelihoods through emergency agricultural assistance, FAO is hence able to provide emergency interventions that save lives and safeguard livelihoods in the short-term while at the same time strengthening resilience in the face of future crises.

FAO&#x2019;s comparative advantages were also highlighted by Sida&#x2019;s evaluation of its strategic partners, which stated that FAO, apart from being a strong player within the thematic areas of food security and livelihoods, also demonstrated strong capacity regarding resilience and nexus programming. The evaluation also concluded that FAO has a comparative advantage in its utilisation of partnerships with local actors and development agencies, which not only ensure sustainability of its interventions but also in many cases means that FAO has good indirect access in remote and hard to reach areas. Finally, the evaluation also recognised FAO&#x2019;s technical expertise as a valuable comparative advantage and highlighted FAO&#x2019;s participation in technical working groups and its leadership role in the food security clusters as well as its contribution to HNO/HRP processes. Specifically, the evaluation highlighted the Sida supported FSNAU intervention as an example of an FAO intervention that was instrumental in providing early warning to the humanitarian system in Somalia, which contributed to avert famine during the severe drought in 2017.

Sida&#x2019;s Humanitarian Follow Up and Field Missions to FAO Responses:

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the staff at Sida&#x2019;s unit for humanitarian assistance based in Stockholm were not able to make as many field follow-ups as per normal. Humanitarian focal points stationed in the Foreign Missions have been crucial to conduct follow-up, as well as digital tools that have allowed for remote monitoring and follow-up. Overall, the conclusions of continuous dialogue, monitoring and follow-up show that FAO is a professional humanitarian actor which, through its extensive network of partners, has the ability to gain access to very remote and hard to reach areas. Sida also notes that FAO in several contexts through its vast technical expertise, plays an important role in technical working groups and coordination fora in the project countries.

THE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 2021

According to the Global Humanitarian Overview, in 2021, 235 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance and protection &#x2013; a substantial increase compared to 2020 which started out with nearly 168 million people in need. Thus resulting in yet another year with the highest number of people in need ever recorded by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In parallel with staggering numbers of people in need, the funding gap increases and according to OCHA&#x2019;s Financial Tracking Service (FTS), response plans and appeals were only 46% funded in 2020, compared to 61% in 2019. In 2021 the UN and partner organisations aim to help 160 million people most in need across 56 countries, with an estimated requirement of 35 billion USD.

Both the increase in people in need and funding gap can be partly derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Putting additional pressure onto an already strained humanitarian system with limited resources. Although COVID-19 has definitely been centre stage during 2020, there are still other worrying trends affecting the global humanitarian outlook for 2021.

First, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the vulnerability of the least protected populations. The pandemic has triggered the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Extreme poverty has risen for the first time in 22 years, and unemployment has increased dramatically. The impact of the socio-economic situation will continue to have serious implications on humanitarian needs in 2021.

Second, political conflicts are more intense and are taking a heavy toll on civilians, disproportionally affecting children. Women and girls are at increased risk of conflict-related sexual violence. As such, protecting those affected by armed conflict is more crucial than ever. The lack of respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) continues to be one of the most pressing challenges. Armed conflicts continue to cause enormous suffering, including violations of IHL, such as killings, torture, abductions and displacements. Applying a protection lens/Centrality of Protection approach is essential &#x2013; in light of the protection crises such as the Syria crisis - now active for more than a decade; Yemen - being the largest humanitarian crisis worldwide; the DR Congo; the Venezuela crisis; the Nagorno-Karabach situation and the Rohingya crisis &#x2013; just to mention a few.

Third, hunger is on the rise, with conflict the main driver of acute hunger for 77 million people in 22 countries. By the end of 2020, the number of acutely food insecure people could be 270 million. The impacts of the pandemic and climate change are seriously affecting food systems worldwide.

Fourth, climate change exacerbate humanitarian needs and extreme weather events. The desert locust outbreak from late 2019 was the worst in 25 years in the Horn of Africa.  A series of flooding situations have taken place in 2020 where we have seen increased humanitarian needs and the displacement of vulnerable populations in contexts such as Sahel, South-East Asia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and South Sudan.   

Fifth, as a result of the above, displacements are at record high levels. Conflict, violence and natural disasters drive people to seek refuge in either their country of origin or by crossing international borders. The majority of the 80 million people living in displacement have been forced to seek refuge due to natural disasters. The number of refugees, most of which seek refuge in neighbouring countries, has doubled from 10 million to 20 million in 10 years.

Sida&#x2019;s humanitarian allocation to FAO in 2021

Sida&#xB4;s humanitarian assistance is based on the four humanitarian principles, in particular impartiality, with its compelling urge to ensure that humanitarian action is carried out based on needs alone, giving priority to the most urgent cases of distress. Hence, Sida&#x2019;s allocation methodology is grounded in several objective indicators such as; the scale of humanitarian needs (number of people in need), the severity of humanitarian needs (including food insecurity/IPC levels), the number of people targeted for the humanitarian response, the financial coverage of the respective humanitarian appeal, national capacities to respond and underlying risks, as well as distinct indicators related to forgotten crises. The allocation and subsequent disbursement of funds takes place in the beginning of the year to ensure predictability for Sida&#x2019;s strategic humanitarian partners and to allow for optimal operational planning.

Based on Sida&apos;s humanitarian needs-based allocation process in late 2020 the following is proposed for FAO in 2021:

- Annual Projects/Programmes in line with Humanitarian Response Plans (usually 12 months) - 67 000 000 SEK
- Rapid Response Mechanism (SFERA) - 25 000 000 SEK
- Method Development and Capacity-Building - 2 000 000 SEK

This means that the total initial contribution to FAO in 2021 amounts to 94 000 000 SEK.

Annual Projects/Programmes (in line with the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plans):

- Afghanistan: 30 000 000 SEK

- Nigeria: 9 000 000 SEK

- Somalia: 12 000 000 SEK

- Somalia (FSNAU): 4 000 000 SEK

- South Sudan: 12 000 000 SEK

Rapid Response Mechanism or unallocated funds:

- SFERA: 25 000 000 SEK

Method- and capacity-building support

- Global Food Security Cluster: 2 000 000 SEK</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAO&#x2019;s Global Goals are:
1. Eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times have sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life;
2. Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods;
3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.
Based on the global goals, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives:
1. Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition
2. Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable
3. Reduce rural poverty
4. Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems
5. Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises
The Strategic Framework also includes a sixth, broad objective on technical quality, knowledge and services (including cross-cutting themes) that is designed to cover FAO&#x2019;s internal capability to deliver its strategic objectives. The objectives are in alignment with FAO&#x2019;s commitment to working in partnerships.
In humanitarian crises, FAO&#x2019;s main components are:
To help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.
The humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):
OO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;
OO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.
At the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:
Output 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.
Output 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.
Output 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).
Output 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.
As Sida support FAO&#x2019;s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida&#x2019;s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.</narrative>

Beslutet omfattar finansiellt st&#xF6;d till FAO om totalt 102 000 000 kronor, varav 94 000 000 kronor &#xE5;r 2021.

Sidas humanit&#xE4;ra enhet har under 2020 genomf&#xF6;rt en &#xF6;versyn av samtliga strategiska partners i syfte att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla samarbete med de mest relevanta och effektiva humanit&#xE4;ra akt&#xF6;rerna f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av Sveriges humanit&#xE4;ra strategi genom Sida (2021-2025). Som ett resultat av &#xF6;versynen har Sida beslutat att bereda ny insats och ing&#xE5; nytt strategiskt partnerskap med FAO, se beslut 2021-000057.

Syftet f&#xF6;r beslutet &#xE4;r att st&#xF6;dja FAO:s humanit&#xE4;ra verksamhet under 2021 samt ing&#xE5; strategiskt partnerskap f&#xF6;r perioden 2021 &#x2013; 2025.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. The organisation&apos;s goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide.

FAO works side by side with the other two Rome-based UN agencies &#x2013; the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to promote food security by alleviating hunger through emergency food assistance as well as more long-term support to eliminate the root causes of food insecurity. While WFP&#x2019;s main comparative advantage lies in its capacity for large-scale food response, logistics, telecommunications and procurement capacity, the advantage of FAO lies in its role as the world&#x2019;s agricultural knowledge agency with its unique agricultural expertise but also in its holistic approach to humanitarian crises, which includes analysis of the entire food system, including cultivation, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing and consumption.

FAO also plays an important normative role, through international agreements, codes of conduct, and voluntary guidelines as well as policy dialogue at global, regional and national levels and advocacy in areas relevant to FAO&#x2019;s mandate.

Alignment with strategy

The objectives of FAO are in line with the strategy for Sweden&apos;s Humanitarian Assistance through Sida (2021-2025) and through its operations, FAO is strengthening the capacity and effectiveness of the humanitarian system. The contribution is relevant for all objectives in the strategy, with an emphasis on the strategy area on protection and assistance to crisis affected populations.

This is an appraisal and subsequent decision of a new contribution (Decision on Contribution, Rule for Managing Contributions 2.9 &#xA7;) between Sida and FAO, to allow for humanitarian response in four crises for 2021.

This decision also includes support for rapid response to new and deteriorating humanitarian crises through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) and Method-Development support through the Global Food Security Cluster.

This decision concerns a financial contribution to FAO amounting to 102 000 000 SEK.

Reasons for the decision

Evaluation 2020

During 2020, the humanitarian assistance unit at Sida conducted an overview of ongoing strategic partnerships in order to ensure that partnership was established with the most relevant and effective humanitarian actors to carry out Sweden&#x2019;s strategy for humanitarian assistance through Sida (2021 &#x2013; 2025). As a result of the overview, Sida has decided to appraise a new contribution and enter into a new strategic partnership agreement with FAO, see decision 2021-000057.

Comparative Advantage of FAO:

Based on the organisation&#x2019;s mandate to build a world without hunger through technical cooperation and assistance, FAO has a unique role to play in humanitarian settings. Through its long-standing country presence, technical expertise in agriculture and food systems, as well as expertise and experience in both humanitarian assistance and development cooperation, FAO is well-placed to address both acute hunger as well as to support countries experiencing food crises to return to normality and building resilience to future chocks. By protecting livelihoods through emergency agricultural assistance, FAO is hence able to provide emergency interventions that save lives and safeguard livelihoods in the short-term while at the same time strengthening resilience in the face of future crises.

FAO&#x2019;s comparative advantages were also highlighted by Sida&#x2019;s evaluation of its strategic partners, which stated that FAO, apart from being a strong player within the thematic areas of food security and livelihoods, also demonstrated strong capacity regarding resilience and nexus programming. The evaluation also concluded that FAO has a comparative advantage in its utilisation of partnerships with local actors and development agencies, which not only ensure sustainability of its interventions but also in many cases means that FAO has good indirect access in remote and hard to reach areas. Finally, the evaluation also recognised FAO&#x2019;s technical expertise as a valuable comparative advantage and highlighted FAO&#x2019;s participation in technical working groups and its leadership role in the food security clusters as well as its contribution to HNO/HRP processes. Specifically, the evaluation highlighted the Sida supported FSNAU intervention as an example of an FAO intervention that was instrumental in providing early warning to the humanitarian system in Somalia, which contributed to avert famine during the severe drought in 2017.

Sida&#x2019;s Humanitarian Follow Up and Field Missions to FAO Responses:

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the staff at Sida&#x2019;s unit for humanitarian assistance based in Stockholm were not able to make as many field follow-ups as per normal. Humanitarian focal points stationed in the Foreign Missions have been crucial to conduct follow-up, as well as digital tools that have allowed for remote monitoring and follow-up. Overall, the conclusions of continuous dialogue, monitoring and follow-up show that FAO is a professional humanitarian actor which, through its extensive network of partners, has the ability to gain access to very remote and hard to reach areas. Sida also notes that FAO in several contexts through its vast technical expertise, plays an important role in technical working groups and coordination fora in the project countries.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAO&#x2019;s Global Goals are:
1. Eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times have sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life;
2. Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods;
3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.
Based on the global goals, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives:
1. Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition
2. Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable
3. Reduce rural poverty
4. Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems
5. Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises
The Strategic Framework also includes a sixth, broad objective on technical quality, knowledge and services (including cross-cutting themes) that is designed to cover FAO&#x2019;s internal capability to deliver its strategic objectives. The objectives are in alignment with FAO&#x2019;s commitment to working in partnerships.
In humanitarian crises, FAO&#x2019;s main components are:
To help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.
The humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):
OO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;
OO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.
At the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:
Output 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.
Output 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.
Output 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).
Output 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.
As Sida support FAO&#x2019;s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida&#x2019;s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.</narrative>

Beslutet omfattar finansiellt st&#xF6;d till FAO om totalt 102 000 000 kronor, varav 94 000 000 kronor &#xE5;r 2021.

Sidas humanit&#xE4;ra enhet har under 2020 genomf&#xF6;rt en &#xF6;versyn av samtliga strategiska partners i syfte att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla samarbete med de mest relevanta och effektiva humanit&#xE4;ra akt&#xF6;rerna f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av Sveriges humanit&#xE4;ra strategi genom Sida (2021-2025). Som ett resultat av &#xF6;versynen har Sida beslutat att bereda ny insats och ing&#xE5; nytt strategiskt partnerskap med FAO, se beslut 2021-000057.

Syftet f&#xF6;r beslutet &#xE4;r att st&#xF6;dja FAO:s humanit&#xE4;ra verksamhet under 2021 samt ing&#xE5; strategiskt partnerskap f&#xF6;r perioden 2021 &#x2013; 2025.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. The organisation&apos;s goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide.

FAO works side by side with the other two Rome-based UN agencies &#x2013; the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to promote food security by alleviating hunger through emergency food assistance as well as more long-term support to eliminate the root causes of food insecurity. While WFP&#x2019;s main comparative advantage lies in its capacity for large-scale food response, logistics, telecommunications and procurement capacity, the advantage of FAO lies in its role as the world&#x2019;s agricultural knowledge agency with its unique agricultural expertise but also in its holistic approach to humanitarian crises, which includes analysis of the entire food system, including cultivation, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing and consumption.

FAO also plays an important normative role, through international agreements, codes of conduct, and voluntary guidelines as well as policy dialogue at global, regional and national levels and advocacy in areas relevant to FAO&#x2019;s mandate.

Alignment with strategy

The objectives of FAO are in line with the strategy for Sweden&apos;s Humanitarian Assistance through Sida (2021-2025) and through its operations, FAO is strengthening the capacity and effectiveness of the humanitarian system. The contribution is relevant for all objectives in the strategy, with an emphasis on the strategy area on protection and assistance to crisis affected populations.

This is an appraisal and subsequent decision of a new contribution (Decision on Contribution, Rule for Managing Contributions 2.9 &#xA7;) between Sida and FAO, to allow for humanitarian response in four crises for 2021.

This decision also includes support for rapid response to new and deteriorating humanitarian crises through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) and Method-Development support through the Global Food Security Cluster.

This decision concerns a financial contribution to FAO amounting to 102 000 000 SEK.

Reasons for the decision

Evaluation 2020

During 2020, the humanitarian assistance unit at Sida conducted an overview of ongoing strategic partnerships in order to ensure that partnership was established with the most relevant and effective humanitarian actors to carry out Sweden&#x2019;s strategy for humanitarian assistance through Sida (2021 &#x2013; 2025). As a result of the overview, Sida has decided to appraise a new contribution and enter into a new strategic partnership agreement with FAO, see decision 2021-000057.

Comparative Advantage of FAO:

Based on the organisation&#x2019;s mandate to build a world without hunger through technical cooperation and assistance, FAO has a unique role to play in humanitarian settings. Through its long-standing country presence, technical expertise in agriculture and food systems, as well as expertise and experience in both humanitarian assistance and development cooperation, FAO is well-placed to address both acute hunger as well as to support countries experiencing food crises to return to normality and building resilience to future chocks. By protecting livelihoods through emergency agricultural assistance, FAO is hence able to provide emergency interventions that save lives and safeguard livelihoods in the short-term while at the same time strengthening resilience in the face of future crises.

FAO&#x2019;s comparative advantages were also highlighted by Sida&#x2019;s evaluation of its strategic partners, which stated that FAO, apart from being a strong player within the thematic areas of food security and livelihoods, also demonstrated strong capacity regarding resilience and nexus programming. The evaluation also concluded that FAO has a comparative advantage in its utilisation of partnerships with local actors and development agencies, which not only ensure sustainability of its interventions but also in many cases means that FAO has good indirect access in remote and hard to reach areas. Finally, the evaluation also recognised FAO&#x2019;s technical expertise as a valuable comparative advantage and highlighted FAO&#x2019;s participation in technical working groups and its leadership role in the food security clusters as well as its contribution to HNO/HRP processes. Specifically, the evaluation highlighted the Sida supported FSNAU intervention as an example of an FAO intervention that was instrumental in providing early warning to the humanitarian system in Somalia, which contributed to avert famine during the severe drought in 2017.

Sida&#x2019;s Humanitarian Follow Up and Field Missions to FAO Responses:

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the staff at Sida&#x2019;s unit for humanitarian assistance based in Stockholm were not able to make as many field follow-ups as per normal. Humanitarian focal points stationed in the Foreign Missions have been crucial to conduct follow-up, as well as digital tools that have allowed for remote monitoring and follow-up. Overall, the conclusions of continuous dialogue, monitoring and follow-up show that FAO is a professional humanitarian actor which, through its extensive network of partners, has the ability to gain access to very remote and hard to reach areas. Sida also notes that FAO in several contexts through its vast technical expertise, plays an important role in technical working groups and coordination fora in the project countries.

THE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 2021

According to the Global Humanitarian Overview, in 2021, 235 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance and protection &#x2013; a substantial increase compared to 2020 which started out with nearly 168 million people in need. Thus resulting in yet another year with the highest number of people in need ever recorded by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In parallel with staggering numbers of people in need, the funding gap increases and according to OCHA&#x2019;s Financial Tracking Service (FTS), response plans and appeals were only 46% funded in 2020, compared to 61% in 2019. In 2021 the UN and partner organisations aim to help 160 million people most in need across 56 countries, with an estimated requirement of 35 billion USD.

Both the increase in people in need and funding gap can be partly derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Putting additional pressure onto an already strained humanitarian system with limited resources. Although COVID-19 has definitely been centre stage during 2020, there are still other worrying trends affecting the global humanitarian outlook for 2021.

First, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the vulnerability of the least protected populations. The pandemic has triggered the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Extreme poverty has risen for the first time in 22 years, and unemployment has increased dramatically. The impact of the socio-economic situation will continue to have serious implications on humanitarian needs in 2021.

Second, political conflicts are more intense and are taking a heavy toll on civilians, disproportionally affecting children. Women and girls are at increased risk of conflict-related sexual violence. As such, protecting those affected by armed conflict is more crucial than ever. The lack of respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) continues to be one of the most pressing challenges. Armed conflicts continue to cause enormous suffering, including violations of IHL, such as killings, torture, abductions and displacements. Applying a protection lens/Centrality of Protection approach is essential &#x2013; in light of the protection crises such as the Syria crisis - now active for more than a decade; Yemen - being the largest humanitarian crisis worldwide; the DR Congo; the Venezuela crisis; the Nagorno-Karabach situation and the Rohingya crisis &#x2013; just to mention a few.

Third, hunger is on the rise, with conflict the main driver of acute hunger for 77 million people in 22 countries. By the end of 2020, the number of acutely food insecure people could be 270 million. The impacts of the pandemic and climate change are seriously affecting food systems worldwide.

Fourth, climate change exacerbate humanitarian needs and extreme weather events. The desert locust outbreak from late 2019 was the worst in 25 years in the Horn of Africa.  A series of flooding situations have taken place in 2020 where we have seen increased humanitarian needs and the displacement of vulnerable populations in contexts such as Sahel, South-East Asia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and South Sudan.   

Fifth, as a result of the above, displacements are at record high levels. Conflict, violence and natural disasters drive people to seek refuge in either their country of origin or by crossing international borders. The majority of the 80 million people living in displacement have been forced to seek refuge due to natural disasters. The number of refugees, most of which seek refuge in neighbouring countries, has doubled from 10 million to 20 million in 10 years.

Sida&#x2019;s humanitarian allocation to FAO in 2021

Sida&#xB4;s humanitarian assistance is based on the four humanitarian principles, in particular impartiality, with its compelling urge to ensure that humanitarian action is carried out based on needs alone, giving priority to the most urgent cases of distress. Hence, Sida&#x2019;s allocation methodology is grounded in several objective indicators such as; the scale of humanitarian needs (number of people in need), the severity of humanitarian needs (including food insecurity/IPC levels), the number of people targeted for the humanitarian response, the financial coverage of the respective humanitarian appeal, national capacities to respond and underlying risks, as well as distinct indicators related to forgotten crises. The allocation and subsequent disbursement of funds takes place in the beginning of the year to ensure predictability for Sida&#x2019;s strategic humanitarian partners and to allow for optimal operational planning.

Based on Sida&apos;s humanitarian needs-based allocation process in late 2020 the following is proposed for FAO in 2021:

- Annual Projects/Programmes in line with Humanitarian Response Plans (usually 12 months) - 67 000 000 SEK
- Rapid Response Mechanism (SFERA) - 25 000 000 SEK
- Method Development and Capacity-Building - 2 000 000 SEK

This means that the total initial contribution to FAO in 2021 amounts to 94 000 000 SEK.

Annual Projects/Programmes (in line with the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plans):

- Afghanistan: 30 000 000 SEK

- Nigeria: 9 000 000 SEK

- Somalia: 12 000 000 SEK

- Somalia (FSNAU): 4 000 000 SEK

- South Sudan: 12 000 000 SEK

Rapid Response Mechanism or unallocated funds:

- SFERA: 25 000 000 SEK

Method- and capacity-building support

- Global Food Security Cluster: 2 000 000 SEK</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. The organisation&apos;s goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide.

FAO works side by side with the other two Rome-based UN agencies &#x2013; the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to promote food security by alleviating hunger through emergency food assistance as well as more long-term support to eliminate the root causes of food insecurity. While WFP&#x2019;s main comparative advantage lies in its capacity for large-scale food response, logistics, telecommunications and procurement capacity, the advantage of FAO lies in its role as the world&#x2019;s agricultural knowledge agency with its unique agricultural expertise but also in its holistic approach to humanitarian crises, which includes analysis of the entire food system, including cultivation, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing and consumption.

FAO also plays an important normative role, through international agreements, codes of conduct, and voluntary guidelines as well as policy dialogue at global, regional and national levels and advocacy in areas relevant to FAO&#x2019;s mandate.

Alignment with strategy

The objectives of FAO are in line with the strategy for Sweden&apos;s Humanitarian Assistance through Sida (2021-2025) and through its operations, FAO is strengthening the capacity and effectiveness of the humanitarian system. The contribution is relevant for all objectives in the strategy, with an emphasis on the strategy area on protection and assistance to crisis affected populations.

This is an appraisal and subsequent decision of a new contribution (Decision on Contribution, Rule for Managing Contributions 2.9 &#xA7;) between Sida and FAO, to allow for humanitarian response in four crises for 2021.

This decision also includes support for rapid response to new and deteriorating humanitarian crises through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) and Method-Development support through the Global Food Security Cluster.

This decision concerns a financial contribution to FAO amounting to 102 000 000 SEK.

Reasons for the decision

Evaluation 2020

During 2020, the humanitarian assistance unit at Sida conducted an overview of ongoing strategic partnerships in order to ensure that partnership was established with the most relevant and effective humanitarian actors to carry out Sweden&#x2019;s strategy for humanitarian assistance through Sida (2021 &#x2013; 2025). As a result of the overview, Sida has decided to appraise a new contribution and enter into a new strategic partnership agreement with FAO, see decision 2021-000057.

Comparative Advantage of FAO:

Based on the organisation&#x2019;s mandate to build a world without hunger through technical cooperation and assistance, FAO has a unique role to play in humanitarian settings. Through its long-standing country presence, technical expertise in agriculture and food systems, as well as expertise and experience in both humanitarian assistance and development cooperation, FAO is well-placed to address both acute hunger as well as to support countries experiencing food crises to return to normality and building resilience to future chocks. By protecting livelihoods through emergency agricultural assistance, FAO is hence able to provide emergency interventions that save lives and safeguard livelihoods in the short-term while at the same time strengthening resilience in the face of future crises.

FAO&#x2019;s comparative advantages were also highlighted by Sida&#x2019;s evaluation of its strategic partners, which stated that FAO, apart from being a strong player within the thematic areas of food security and livelihoods, also demonstrated strong capacity regarding resilience and nexus programming. The evaluation also concluded that FAO has a comparative advantage in its utilisation of partnerships with local actors and development agencies, which not only ensure sustainability of its interventions but also in many cases means that FAO has good indirect access in remote and hard to reach areas. Finally, the evaluation also recognised FAO&#x2019;s technical expertise as a valuable comparative advantage and highlighted FAO&#x2019;s participation in technical working groups and its leadership role in the food security clusters as well as its contribution to HNO/HRP processes. Specifically, the evaluation highlighted the Sida supported FSNAU intervention as an example of an FAO intervention that was instrumental in providing early warning to the humanitarian system in Somalia, which contributed to avert famine during the severe drought in 2017.

Sida&#x2019;s Humanitarian Follow Up and Field Missions to FAO Responses:

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the staff at Sida&#x2019;s unit for humanitarian assistance based in Stockholm were not able to make as many field follow-ups as per normal. Humanitarian focal points stationed in the Foreign Missions have been crucial to conduct follow-up, as well as digital tools that have allowed for remote monitoring and follow-up. Overall, the conclusions of continuous dialogue, monitoring and follow-up show that FAO is a professional humanitarian actor which, through its extensive network of partners, has the ability to gain access to very remote and hard to reach areas. Sida also notes that FAO in several contexts through its vast technical expertise, plays an important role in technical working groups and coordination fora in the project countries.

THE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 2021

According to the Global Humanitarian Overview, in 2021, 235 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance and protection &#x2013; a substantial increase compared to 2020 which started out with nearly 168 million people in need. Thus resulting in yet another year with the highest number of people in need ever recorded by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In parallel with staggering numbers of people in need, the funding gap increases and according to OCHA&#x2019;s Financial Tracking Service (FTS), response plans and appeals were only 46% funded in 2020, compared to 61% in 2019. In 2021 the UN and partner organisations aim to help 160 million people most in need across 56 countries, with an estimated requirement of 35 billion USD.

Both the increase in people in need and funding gap can be partly derived from the COVID-19 pandemic. Putting additional pressure onto an already strained humanitarian system with limited resources. Although COVID-19 has definitely been centre stage during 2020, there are still other worrying trends affecting the global humanitarian outlook for 2021.

First, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the vulnerability of the least protected populations. The pandemic has triggered the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Extreme poverty has risen for the first time in 22 years, and unemployment has increased dramatically. The impact of the socio-economic situation will continue to have serious implications on humanitarian needs in 2021.

Second, political conflicts are more intense and are taking a heavy toll on civilians, disproportionally affecting children. Women and girls are at increased risk of conflict-related sexual violence. As such, protecting those affected by armed conflict is more crucial than ever. The lack of respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) continues to be one of the most pressing challenges. Armed conflicts continue to cause enormous suffering, including violations of IHL, such as killings, torture, abductions and displacements. Applying a protection lens/Centrality of Protection approach is essential &#x2013; in light of the protection crises such as the Syria crisis - now active for more than a decade; Yemen - being the largest humanitarian crisis worldwide; the DR Congo; the Venezuela crisis; the Nagorno-Karabach situation and the Rohingya crisis &#x2013; just to mention a few.

Third, hunger is on the rise, with conflict the main driver of acute hunger for 77 million people in 22 countries. By the end of 2020, the number of acutely food insecure people could be 270 million. The impacts of the pandemic and climate change are seriously affecting food systems worldwide.

Fourth, climate change exacerbate humanitarian needs and extreme weather events. The desert locust outbreak from late 2019 was the worst in 25 years in the Horn of Africa.  A series of flooding situations have taken place in 2020 where we have seen increased humanitarian needs and the displacement of vulnerable populations in contexts such as Sahel, South-East Asia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and South Sudan.   

Fifth, as a result of the above, displacements are at record high levels. Conflict, violence and natural disasters drive people to seek refuge in either their country of origin or by crossing international borders. The majority of the 80 million people living in displacement have been forced to seek refuge due to natural disasters. The number of refugees, most of which seek refuge in neighbouring countries, has doubled from 10 million to 20 million in 10 years.

Sida&#x2019;s humanitarian allocation to FAO in 2021

Sida&#xB4;s humanitarian assistance is based on the four humanitarian principles, in particular impartiality, with its compelling urge to ensure that humanitarian action is carried out based on needs alone, giving priority to the most urgent cases of distress. Hence, Sida&#x2019;s allocation methodology is grounded in several objective indicators such as; the scale of humanitarian needs (number of people in need), the severity of humanitarian needs (including food insecurity/IPC levels), the number of people targeted for the humanitarian response, the financial coverage of the respective humanitarian appeal, national capacities to respond and underlying risks, as well as distinct indicators related to forgotten crises. The allocation and subsequent disbursement of funds takes place in the beginning of the year to ensure predictability for Sida&#x2019;s strategic humanitarian partners and to allow for optimal operational planning.

Based on Sida&apos;s humanitarian needs-based allocation process in late 2020 the following is proposed for FAO in 2021:

- Annual Projects/Programmes in line with Humanitarian Response Plans (usually 12 months) - 67 000 000 SEK
- Rapid Response Mechanism (SFERA) - 25 000 000 SEK
- Method Development and Capacity-Building - 2 000 000 SEK

This means that the total initial contribution to FAO in 2021 amounts to 94 000 000 SEK.

Annual Projects/Programmes (in line with the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plans):

- Afghanistan: 30 000 000 SEK

- Nigeria: 9 000 000 SEK

- Somalia: 12 000 000 SEK

- Somalia (FSNAU): 4 000 000 SEK

- South Sudan: 12 000 000 SEK

Rapid Response Mechanism or unallocated funds:

- SFERA: 25 000 000 SEK

Method- and capacity-building support

- Global Food Security Cluster: 2 000 000 SEK</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAO&#x2019;s Global Goals are:
1. Eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times have sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life;
2. Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods;
3. Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations.
Based on the global goals, FAO has formulated five strategic objectives:
1. Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition
2. Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and sustainable
3. Reduce rural poverty
4. Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems
5. Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises
The Strategic Framework also includes a sixth, broad objective on technical quality, knowledge and services (including cross-cutting themes) that is designed to cover FAO&#x2019;s internal capability to deliver its strategic objectives. The objectives are in alignment with FAO&#x2019;s commitment to working in partnerships.
In humanitarian crises, FAO&#x2019;s main components are:
To help people to anticipate and prepare for crises; To respond fast to crises; To seek to reduce risks and address vulnerabilities.
The humanitarian operations are usually related to the 5th strategic objective which has the four following organizational outcomes (OO):
OO1 - countries and regions have legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO2 - countries and regions deliver regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food, and nutrition;
OO3 - countries apply prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks for agriculture, food and nutrition;
OO4 - countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition are prepared for, and manage effective responses.
At the next level in the FAO Strategic Framework, there are a number of outputs pertinent to humanitarian action, such as:
Output 4.1: Humanitarian action effectively protect lives and livelihoods of farmers, herders, Fishers, forest- and tree-dependent communities and marginal groups in times of crises.
Output 3.1: Strategies and related interventions improve the resilience of livelihoods systems at risk through prevention and mitigation efforts that minimize the potential impacts of disasters and crises on agriculture food and nutrition at national, subnational and community levels.
Output 2.2: Improved capacities of countries and communities to identify monitor and evaluate risks; conduct needs assessment and response analysis; and act on impending threats to agriculture, nutrition, food security and food safety (and related public health issues).
Output 3.3: Conflict-sensitive programmes on agriculture, food and nutrition reduce the risks of localized conflicts relating to access to grazing, forest and farming lands, fishing grounds, water, trees and other natural resources.
As Sida support FAO&#x2019;s operations through a variety of different projects in different contexts, this appraisal does not include an overarching results framework. In the annual follow up reading up to Sida&#x2019;s conclusion on performance all individual project reports will be analysed and assessed.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This contribution is aimed at supporting Oxfam in selected humanitarian crisis where Oxfam will implement specific projects and where the organisation has a clear added value to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to crisis affected populations.
In 2020 Oxfam launched its new Global Strategic Framework 2020-2030. The framework was developed over a one-year process that involved Oxfam staff and partners across its global confederation. It sets out the overall direction that Oxfam will take in the years to 2030. According to Oxfam, implementation of the framework will be supported by global horizon plans that will set out specific objectives, systemic interventions, and actions. These plans will serve as a roadmaps for measuring progress towards Oxfam&#x2019;s collective ambition. A combination of six approaches is presented in the framework and will constitute Oxfam&#x2019;s overarching theory of change. These include:
A feminist approach- To end all forms of discrimination, injustices and violations of rights suffered by women and gender non-conforming people
People power &#x2013; Amplify the voices and actions of people that experience poverty and injustice and work with those who fight for their causes
Thinking globally and acting locally- Build a coalition within and between regions and from the local to the global
Enhanced humanitarian action- remain committed to delivering life-saving assistance and protection in times of conflict and disaster
Digital rights and space- to engage with and leverage the power and influence of digital technology
Systematic change &#x2013; Mobilize to transform the systems that perpetuate poverty and injustice.
The strategy also outlines Oxfam&#x2019;s approach to enhance its humanitarian actions which involves 1) deliveing life-saving support and assistance to communities affected by conflict and disaster, including people on the move; 2) transforming the systems that contribute to fragility and humanitarian crises;3) helping people and communities develop core competencies to strengthen their resilience; 4) continue to reorient the humanitarian system towards local leadership, and; 5) expanding opportunities for those impacted by protracted conflict and recurring crises to lead on sustainable solutions.
At the operational level the global strategic framework reaffirms Oxfam&#x2019;s commitment to humanitarian assistance in the technical areas of WASH, Economic Inclusion, Cash and social protection based approaches, Gender, Community based protection and safe programming, and finally advocacy work to complement programmes in particular on women in conflict.
In&#xA0;all the technical areas there are four pillars that will inform the humanitarian approach including 1) Community Engagement; 2) Safe Programming; 3) Partnership and Leadership, 4) Feminist approach. Oxfam is currently working on its Horizon Plan for humanitarian action, which will give practical and pragmatic guidance on expectations for Oxfam countries on its humanitarian ambition, how it is changing in approach and alignment of appropriate support.&#xA0;&#xA0;
In 2021/2022 Sida will support Oxfam&#x2019;s humanitarian interventions in 4 different crises as well as its immediate response to new onset crises or rapidly deteriorating situations through the rapid response mechanisms (RRM). The specific objective of each project might differ, but Oxfam&#x2019;s core objective within its humanitarian mandate is to work with communities before, during and after crisis to build their resilience, save lives, and together address the root causes of conflict and disaster. 
Sida will also support a project implemented by Oxfam to improve the use of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis as a tool for ascertaining food insecurity, as well as support to CaLP in order to strengthen the system wide use of CVA as a modality in humanitarian interventions.&#xA0;&#xA0;
The following provides a brief description of the projects objectives and intended results:
Algeria&#xA0;(10 MSEK) &#x2013;&#xA0;Refugees from Western Sahara have been living in 5 refugee camps in Tindouf region, southwestern Algeria since 1975 due to an on-going dispute over the control of the Western Sahara Territory. With no imminent political solution to this protracted crisis in sight, the refugee population is largely dependent on external humanitarian aid for its survival. 94% of refugees remain dependent on humanitarian aid as their primary source of support, including for the provision of food, water and other basic needs.
The intervention aims to&#xA0;strengthen the resilience amongst 133 672 Sahrawi refugees to meet their basic needs, with a focus on food security and water and sanitation. Food security will be improved through the promotion of local agricultural production and distribution of fresh food during challenging summer months. In line with the official UN 5-year WaSH Strategy and Plan, the piped water network in Boujdour camp (which has relied completely on water trucking to date) will be extended, serving as a model which can later be adapted and scaled up in other camps.
Colombia (9 MSEK) -&#xA0; During 2020, refugees and migrants from Venezuela continued arriving in Colombia, with an estimated 1,7 million remaining in the country and half a million in transit to other countries. This situation was further exacerbated by the impact of natural disasters, generalized violence in certain areas, and since March, by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This intervention is part of Oxfam&#xB4;s broad protection strategy to Venezuelan mixed migration flux. It is based on two main components: 1) a strategy to promote sexual and reproductive rights through access to short and medium-term contraceptive methods, accompanied by legal, medical and psychological counselling to manage cases of gender-based violence, and 2) a focused women migrant walkers&apos; program that provides information to tackle risks, reduce vulnerability and strengthen capacities of migrants to avoid risks and mitigate their effects. The project targets approximately 5&#xA0;000 migrants with protection and NFI assistance.
Central African Republic (CAR) (10 MSEK) -&#xA0;Clashes between rebels and government forces in various cities has caused further deterioration of the security situation in CAR since late December 2020, resulting in 105&#xA0;000 new refugees and 100&#xA0;000 new IDPs in the beginning of February 2021. The situation affects the sectors of food security; water, hygiene and sanitation; protection and gender, and particularly affects the prefectures of Ouham, Ouham-Pend&#xE9; and Mbomou in which the project will be implemented.
The intervention aims to improve the protection and living conditions of displaced, returnee and host communities in the target areas by strengthening access to food security and livelihoods, improving access to WASH services and building the capacity of affected populations to prevent and respond to protection risks.&#xA0;The project will target approximately 67 000 people across these three areas. In line with Oxfam&#x2019;s localisation of aid commitments under the Grand Bargain and the Charter for Change, Oxfam will implement this intervention jointly with local humanitarian agencies.
Chad (7 MSEK)&#xA0;&#x2013; Chad is facing three interconnected crises: food insecurity and malnutrition, population movements (481 645 refugees, 336 124 IDPs, and 109 019 new returnees) and health emergencies. The already alarming humanitarian situation in Chad has been further weakened by the suspension of certain humanitarian activities following the implementation of restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The intervention will contribute to the community resilience and self-protection of the displaced populations in the Bagasola and Daboua areas in the Lake region of Chad. It will strengthen IDPs abilities to identify, respond to and mitigate risks and threats to protection. Approximately 40&#xA0;000 people will be targeted. The project also aims to increase people access to water and sanitation facilities through construction and rehabilitation of waterpoints and improvement of people knowledge and practice of public health and hygiene based on community perceptions. Through cash distribution to highly vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities their essential food needs will be met and their livelihoods strengthened.
IPC Project in CAR and Zimbabwe (3 MSEK)
Specific gaps in country IPC processes have been identified by Oxfam and other stakeholders in Zimbabwe and CAR. Each country has had difficulties with data collection and data quality. In CAR, there are problems with both the quantity and the quality of data available to perform the analyses including a lack of surveys data in some geographic areas and information gaps in the available data (e.g., core food security indicators). In Zimbabwe, the government leads the data collection process and NGOs are invited to participate, but sometimes at short notice and at times with resource contributions to the data collection processes as a prerequisite for participation of agencies in IPC analyses. Large surveys organized by government or UN agencies also tend to crowd out viable sources of information produced by smaller organizations that would otherwise add value and diversity to datasets used in analyses.
This interventions is expected to increase the engagement of NGOs (with a goal of at least 4-6 NGOs participating per country) and support expanded plurality in the consensus-building part of the IPC analysis workshop. Greater transparency will be seen through participation of at least two NGO representatives in the full IPC process:&#xA0; pre-analysis (includes primary data collection and preparation), analysis (e.g., workshops), and post-analysis (communication etc.). The project will consolidate one country-based community of practice of agencies involved in IPC per country (CAR and Zimbabwe).
CaLP (4 MSEK)
The Cash and Voucher Assitance (CVA) landscape is characterized by rapid change and evolving opportunities, both at global and national levels. Technological developments and the changing role of governments, private sector and local actors carry major implications for the role of international humanitarian actors. The amount spent on CVA in humanitarian response has doubled in the past three years. At the same time, overall humanitarian funding has plateaued, meaning that CVA is becoming an increasingly critical part of humanitarian response. The use of CVA has also grown in the COVID-19 response, with the Global Humanitarian Response Plan calling for a scale-up of CVA as an effective way to protect the most vulnerable, as well as reduce the deterioration of assets, livelihoods and social cohesion.
The contribution to CaLP will be in support of CaLPs annual plan (2021-2022). The plan&apos;s strategic focus includes fostering collaboration for more effective and sustainable humanitarian CVA, strengthening evidence-based policy and action in order to transform humanitarian CVA and expanding the skills and knowledge required to deliver quality, sustainable humanitarian CVA, at scale.</narrative>

Chad (7 MSEK)&#xA0;&#x2013; Chad is facing three interconnected crises: food insecurity and malnutrition, population movements (481 645 refugees, 336 124 IDPs, and 109 019 new returnees) and health emergencies. The already alarming humanitarian situation in Chad has been further weakened by the suspension of certain humanitarian activities following the implementation of restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The intervention will contribute to the community resilience and self-protection of the displaced populations in the Bagasola and Daboua areas in the Lake region of Chad. It will strengthen IDPs abilities to identify, respond to and mitigate risks and threats to protection. Approximately 40&#xA0;000 people will be targeted. The project also aims to increase people access to water and sanitation facilities through construction and rehabilitation of waterpoints and improvement of people knowledge and practice of public health and hygiene based on community perceptions. Through cash distribution to highly vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities their essential food needs will be met and their livelihoods strengthened.
IPC Project in CAR and Zimbabwe (3 MSEK)
Specific gaps in country IPC processes have been identified by Oxfam and other stakeholders in Zimbabwe and CAR. Each country has had difficulties with data collection and data quality. In CAR, there are problems with both the quantity and the quality of data available to perform the analyses including a lack of surveys data in some geographic areas and information gaps in the available data (e.g., core food security indicators). In Zimbabwe, the government leads the data collection process and NGOs are invited to participate, but sometimes at short notice and at times with resource contributions to the data collection processes as a prerequisite for participation of agencies in IPC analyses. Large surveys organized by government or UN agencies also tend to crowd out viable sources of information produced by smaller organizations that would otherwise add value and diversity to datasets used in analyses.
This interventions is expected to increase the engagement of NGOs (with a goal of at least 4-6 NGOs participating per country) and support expanded plurality in the consensus-building part of the IPC analysis workshop. Greater transparency will be seen through participation of at least two NGO representatives in the full IPC process:&#xA0; pre-analysis (includes primary data collection and preparation), analysis (e.g., workshops), and post-analysis (communication etc.). The project will consolidate one country-based community of practice of agencies involved in IPC per country (CAR and Zimbabwe).
CaLP (4 MSEK)
The Cash and Voucher Assitance (CVA) landscape is characterized by rapid change and evolving opportunities, both at global and national levels. Technological developments and the changing role of governments, private sector and local actors carry major implications for the role of international humanitarian actors. The amount spent on CVA in humanitarian response has doubled in the past three years. At the same time, overall humanitarian funding has plateaued, meaning that CVA is becoming an increasingly critical part of humanitarian response. The use of CVA has also grown in the COVID-19 response, with the Global Humanitarian Response Plan calling for a scale-up of CVA as an effective way to protect the most vulnerable, as well as reduce the deterioration of assets, livelihoods and social cohesion.
The contribution to CaLP will be in support of CaLPs annual plan (2021-2022). The plan&apos;s strategic focus includes fostering collaboration for more effective and sustainable humanitarian CVA, strengthening evidence-based policy and action in order to transform humanitarian CVA and expanding the skills and knowledge required to deliver quality, sustainable humanitarian CVA, at scale.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam has submitted a proposal for financing to Sida for humanitarian response in the following contexts in 2021: Algeria, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, and Colombia. The proposal includes a request for Oxfam&#x2019;s rapid response mechanism (RRM) and for method and capacity support. 

The contribution will be the first year of a strategic partnership that extends between 2021 and 2025 between Oxfam and Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit. The aim of the contribution is to reach people affected by crisis with humanitarian assistance and protection and to contribute to strengthening the capacity of the humanitarian system. All proposed efforts are guided by Oxfam&apos;s core mandate, which is to work with communities before, during and after crises to build their resilience, save lives and tackle the causes of conflict and other disasters.

Oxfam is a global movement of people who are fighting inequality to end poverty and injustice.  Oxfam works in about 70 countries, with partners, and allies. Oxfam GB is one of 20 affiliates that make up the confederation Oxfam International.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This contribution is aimed at supporting Oxfam in selected humanitarian crisis where Oxfam will implement specific projects and where the organisation has a clear added value to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to crisis affected populations.
In 2020 Oxfam launched its new Global Strategic Framework 2020-2030. The framework was developed over a one-year process that involved Oxfam staff and partners across its global confederation. It sets out the overall direction that Oxfam will take in the years to 2030. According to Oxfam, implementation of the framework will be supported by global horizon plans that will set out specific objectives, systemic interventions, and actions. These plans will serve as a roadmaps for measuring progress towards Oxfam&#x2019;s collective ambition. A combination of six approaches is presented in the framework and will constitute Oxfam&#x2019;s overarching theory of change. These include:
A feminist approach- To end all forms of discrimination, injustices and violations of rights suffered by women and gender non-conforming people
People power &#x2013; Amplify the voices and actions of people that experience poverty and injustice and work with those who fight for their causes
Thinking globally and acting locally- Build a coalition within and between regions and from the local to the global
Enhanced humanitarian action- remain committed to delivering life-saving assistance and protection in times of conflict and disaster
Digital rights and space- to engage with and leverage the power and influence of digital technology
Systematic change &#x2013; Mobilize to transform the systems that perpetuate poverty and injustice.
The strategy also outlines Oxfam&#x2019;s approach to enhance its humanitarian actions which involves 1) deliveing life-saving support and assistance to communities affected by conflict and disaster, including people on the move; 2) transforming the systems that contribute to fragility and humanitarian crises;3) helping people and communities develop core competencies to strengthen their resilience; 4) continue to reorient the humanitarian system towards local leadership, and; 5) expanding opportunities for those impacted by protracted conflict and recurring crises to lead on sustainable solutions.
At the operational level the global strategic framework reaffirms Oxfam&#x2019;s commitment to humanitarian assistance in the technical areas of WASH, Economic Inclusion, Cash and social protection based approaches, Gender, Community based protection and safe programming, and finally advocacy work to complement programmes in particular on women in conflict.
In&#xA0;all the technical areas there are four pillars that will inform the humanitarian approach including 1) Community Engagement; 2) Safe Programming; 3) Partnership and Leadership, 4) Feminist approach. Oxfam is currently working on its Horizon Plan for humanitarian action, which will give practical and pragmatic guidance on expectations for Oxfam countries on its humanitarian ambition, how it is changing in approach and alignment of appropriate support.&#xA0;&#xA0;
In 2021/2022 Sida will support Oxfam&#x2019;s humanitarian interventions in 4 different crises as well as its immediate response to new onset crises or rapidly deteriorating situations through the rapid response mechanisms (RRM). The specific objective of each project might differ, but Oxfam&#x2019;s core objective within its humanitarian mandate is to work with communities before, during and after crisis to build their resilience, save lives, and together address the root causes of conflict and disaster. 
Sida will also support a project implemented by Oxfam to improve the use of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis as a tool for ascertaining food insecurity, as well as support to CaLP in order to strengthen the system wide use of CVA as a modality in humanitarian interventions.&#xA0;&#xA0;
The following provides a brief description of the projects objectives and intended results:
Algeria&#xA0;(10 MSEK) &#x2013;&#xA0;Refugees from Western Sahara have been living in 5 refugee camps in Tindouf region, southwestern Algeria since 1975 due to an on-going dispute over the control of the Western Sahara Territory. With no imminent political solution to this protracted crisis in sight, the refugee population is largely dependent on external humanitarian aid for its survival. 94% of refugees remain dependent on humanitarian aid as their primary source of support, including for the provision of food, water and other basic needs.
The intervention aims to&#xA0;strengthen the resilience amongst 133 672 Sahrawi refugees to meet their basic needs, with a focus on food security and water and sanitation. Food security will be improved through the promotion of local agricultural production and distribution of fresh food during challenging summer months. In line with the official UN 5-year WaSH Strategy and Plan, the piped water network in Boujdour camp (which has relied completely on water trucking to date) will be extended, serving as a model which can later be adapted and scaled up in other camps.
Colombia (9 MSEK) -&#xA0; During 2020, refugees and migrants from Venezuela continued arriving in Colombia, with an estimated 1,7 million remaining in the country and half a million in transit to other countries. This situation was further exacerbated by the impact of natural disasters, generalized violence in certain areas, and since March, by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This intervention is part of Oxfam&#xB4;s broad protection strategy to Venezuelan mixed migration flux. It is based on two main components: 1) a strategy to promote sexual and reproductive rights through access to short and medium-term contraceptive methods, accompanied by legal, medical and psychological counselling to manage cases of gender-based violence, and 2) a focused women migrant walkers&apos; program that provides information to tackle risks, reduce vulnerability and strengthen capacities of migrants to avoid risks and mitigate their effects. The project targets approximately 5&#xA0;000 migrants with protection and NFI assistance.
Central African Republic (CAR) (10 MSEK) -&#xA0;Clashes between rebels and government forces in various cities has caused further deterioration of the security situation in CAR since late December 2020, resulting in 105&#xA0;000 new refugees and 100&#xA0;000 new IDPs in the beginning of February 2021. The situation affects the sectors of food security; water, hygiene and sanitation; protection and gender, and particularly affects the prefectures of Ouham, Ouham-Pend&#xE9; and Mbomou in which the project will be implemented.
The intervention aims to improve the protection and living conditions of displaced, returnee and host communities in the target areas by strengthening access to food security and livelihoods, improving access to WASH services and building the capacity of affected populations to prevent and respond to protection risks.&#xA0;The project will target approximately 67 000 people across these three areas. In line with Oxfam&#x2019;s localisation of aid commitments under the Grand Bargain and the Charter for Change, Oxfam will implement this intervention jointly with local humanitarian agencies.
Chad (7 MSEK)&#xA0;&#x2013; Chad is facing three interconnected crises: food insecurity and malnutrition, population movements (481 645 refugees, 336 124 IDPs, and 109 019 new returnees) and health emergencies. The already alarming humanitarian situation in Chad has been further weakened by the suspension of certain humanitarian activities following the implementation of restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This contribution is aimed at supporting Oxfam in selected humanitarian crisis where Oxfam will implement specific projects and where the organisation has a clear added value to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to crisis affected populations.
In 2020 Oxfam launched its new Global Strategic Framework 2020-2030. The framework was developed over a one-year process that involved Oxfam staff and partners across its global confederation. It sets out the overall direction that Oxfam will take in the years to 2030. According to Oxfam, implementation of the framework will be supported by global horizon plans that will set out specific objectives, systemic interventions, and actions. These plans will serve as a roadmaps for measuring progress towards Oxfam&#x2019;s collective ambition. A combination of six approaches is presented in the framework and will constitute Oxfam&#x2019;s overarching theory of change. These include:
A feminist approach- To end all forms of discrimination, injustices and violations of rights suffered by women and gender non-conforming people
People power &#x2013; Amplify the voices and actions of people that experience poverty and injustice and work with those who fight for their causes
Thinking globally and acting locally- Build a coalition within and between regions and from the local to the global
Enhanced humanitarian action- remain committed to delivering life-saving assistance and protection in times of conflict and disaster
Digital rights and space- to engage with and leverage the power and influence of digital technology
Systematic change &#x2013; Mobilize to transform the systems that perpetuate poverty and injustice.
The strategy also outlines Oxfam&#x2019;s approach to enhance its humanitarian actions which involves 1) deliveing life-saving support and assistance to communities affected by conflict and disaster, including people on the move; 2) transforming the systems that contribute to fragility and humanitarian crises;3) helping people and communities develop core competencies to strengthen their resilience; 4) continue to reorient the humanitarian system towards local leadership, and; 5) expanding opportunities for those impacted by protracted conflict and recurring crises to lead on sustainable solutions.
At the operational level the global strategic framework reaffirms Oxfam&#x2019;s commitment to humanitarian assistance in the technical areas of WASH, Economic Inclusion, Cash and social protection based approaches, Gender, Community based protection and safe programming, and finally advocacy work to complement programmes in particular on women in conflict.
In&#xA0;all the technical areas there are four pillars that will inform the humanitarian approach including 1) Community Engagement; 2) Safe Programming; 3) Partnership and Leadership, 4) Feminist approach. Oxfam is currently working on its Horizon Plan for humanitarian action, which will give practical and pragmatic guidance on expectations for Oxfam countries on its humanitarian ambition, how it is changing in approach and alignment of appropriate support.&#xA0;&#xA0;
In 2021/2022 Sida will support Oxfam&#x2019;s humanitarian interventions in 4 different crises as well as its immediate response to new onset crises or rapidly deteriorating situations through the rapid response mechanisms (RRM). The specific objective of each project might differ, but Oxfam&#x2019;s core objective within its humanitarian mandate is to work with communities before, during and after crisis to build their resilience, save lives, and together address the root causes of conflict and disaster. 
Sida will also support a project implemented by Oxfam to improve the use of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis as a tool for ascertaining food insecurity, as well as support to CaLP in order to strengthen the system wide use of CVA as a modality in humanitarian interventions.&#xA0;&#xA0;
The following provides a brief description of the projects objectives and intended results:
Algeria&#xA0;(10 MSEK) &#x2013;&#xA0;Refugees from Western Sahara have been living in 5 refugee camps in Tindouf region, southwestern Algeria since 1975 due to an on-going dispute over the control of the Western Sahara Territory. With no imminent political solution to this protracted crisis in sight, the refugee population is largely dependent on external humanitarian aid for its survival. 94% of refugees remain dependent on humanitarian aid as their primary source of support, including for the provision of food, water and other basic needs.
The intervention aims to&#xA0;strengthen the resilience amongst 133 672 Sahrawi refugees to meet their basic needs, with a focus on food security and water and sanitation. Food security will be improved through the promotion of local agricultural production and distribution of fresh food during challenging summer months. In line with the official UN 5-year WaSH Strategy and Plan, the piped water network in Boujdour camp (which has relied completely on water trucking to date) will be extended, serving as a model which can later be adapted and scaled up in other camps.
Colombia (9 MSEK) -&#xA0; During 2020, refugees and migrants from Venezuela continued arriving in Colombia, with an estimated 1,7 million remaining in the country and half a million in transit to other countries. This situation was further exacerbated by the impact of natural disasters, generalized violence in certain areas, and since March, by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This intervention is part of Oxfam&#xB4;s broad protection strategy to Venezuelan mixed migration flux. It is based on two main components: 1) a strategy to promote sexual and reproductive rights through access to short and medium-term contraceptive methods, accompanied by legal, medical and psychological counselling to manage cases of gender-based violence, and 2) a focused women migrant walkers&apos; program that provides information to tackle risks, reduce vulnerability and strengthen capacities of migrants to avoid risks and mitigate their effects. The project targets approximately 5&#xA0;000 migrants with protection and NFI assistance.
Central African Republic (CAR) (10 MSEK) -&#xA0;Clashes between rebels and government forces in various cities has caused further deterioration of the security situation in CAR since late December 2020, resulting in 105&#xA0;000 new refugees and 100&#xA0;000 new IDPs in the beginning of February 2021. The situation affects the sectors of food security; water, hygiene and sanitation; protection and gender, and particularly affects the prefectures of Ouham, Ouham-Pend&#xE9; and Mbomou in which the project will be implemented.
The intervention aims to improve the protection and living conditions of displaced, returnee and host communities in the target areas by strengthening access to food security and livelihoods, improving access to WASH services and building the capacity of affected populations to prevent and respond to protection risks.&#xA0;The project will target approximately 67 000 people across these three areas. In line with Oxfam&#x2019;s localisation of aid commitments under the Grand Bargain and the Charter for Change, Oxfam will implement this intervention jointly with local humanitarian agencies.
Chad (7 MSEK)&#xA0;&#x2013; Chad is facing three interconnected crises: food insecurity and malnutrition, population movements (481 645 refugees, 336 124 IDPs, and 109 019 new returnees) and health emergencies. The already alarming humanitarian situation in Chad has been further weakened by the suspension of certain humanitarian activities following the implementation of restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The intervention will contribute to the community resilience and self-protection of the displaced populations in the Bagasola and Daboua areas in the Lake region of Chad. It will strengthen IDPs abilities to identify, respond to and mitigate risks and threats to protection. Approximately 40&#xA0;000 people will be targeted. The project also aims to increase people access to water and sanitation facilities through construction and rehabilitation of waterpoints and improvement of people knowledge and practice of public health and hygiene based on community perceptions. Through cash distribution to highly vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities their essential food needs will be met and their livelihoods strengthened.
IPC Project in CAR and Zimbabwe (3 MSEK)
Specific gaps in country IPC processes have been identified by Oxfam and other stakeholders in Zimbabwe and CAR. Each country has had difficulties with data collection and data quality. In CAR, there are problems with both the quantity and the quality of data available to perform the analyses including a lack of surveys data in some geographic areas and information gaps in the available data (e.g., core food security indicators). In Zimbabwe, the government leads the data collection process and NGOs are invited to participate, but sometimes at short notice and at times with resource contributions to the data collection processes as a prerequisite for participation of agencies in IPC analyses. Large surveys organized by government or UN agencies also tend to crowd out viable sources of information produced by smaller organizations that would otherwise add value and diversity to datasets used in analyses.
This interventions is expected to increase the engagement of NGOs (with a goal of at least 4-6 NGOs participating per country) and support expanded plurality in the consensus-building part of the IPC analysis workshop. Greater transparency will be seen through participation of at least two NGO representatives in the full IPC process:&#xA0; pre-analysis (includes primary data collection and preparation), analysis (e.g., workshops), and post-analysis (communication etc.). The project will consolidate one country-based community of practice of agencies involved in IPC per country (CAR and Zimbabwe).
CaLP (4 MSEK)
The Cash and Voucher Assitance (CVA) landscape is characterized by rapid change and evolving opportunities, both at global and national levels. Technological developments and the changing role of governments, private sector and local actors carry major implications for the role of international humanitarian actors. The amount spent on CVA in humanitarian response has doubled in the past three years. At the same time, overall humanitarian funding has plateaued, meaning that CVA is becoming an increasingly critical part of humanitarian response. The use of CVA has also grown in the COVID-19 response, with the Global Humanitarian Response Plan calling for a scale-up of CVA as an effective way to protect the most vulnerable, as well as reduce the deterioration of assets, livelihoods and social cohesion.
The contribution to CaLP will be in support of CaLPs annual plan (2021-2022). The plan&apos;s strategic focus includes fostering collaboration for more effective and sustainable humanitarian CVA, strengthening evidence-based policy and action in order to transform humanitarian CVA and expanding the skills and knowledge required to deliver quality, sustainable humanitarian CVA, at scale.</narrative>

The situation affects the sectors of food security; water, hygiene and sanitation; protection and gender, and particularly affects the prefectures of Ouham, Ouham-Pend&#xE9; and Mbomou in which the project will be implemented.
The intervention aims to improve the protection and living conditions of displaced, returnee and host communities in the target areas by strengthening access to food security and livelihoods, improving access to WASH services and building the capacity of affected populations to prevent and respond to protection risks.&#xA0;The project will target approximately 67 000 people across these three areas. In line with Oxfam&#x2019;s localisation of aid commitments under the Grand Bargain and the Charter for Change, Oxfam will implement this intervention jointly with local humanitarian agencies.
Chad (7 MSEK)&#xA0;&#x2013; Chad is facing three interconnected crises: food insecurity and malnutrition, population movements (481 645 refugees, 336 124 IDPs, and 109 019 new returnees) and health emergencies. The already alarming humanitarian situation in Chad has been further weakened by the suspension of certain humanitarian activities following the implementation of restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The intervention will contribute to the community resilience and self-protection of the displaced populations in the Bagasola and Daboua areas in the Lake region of Chad. It will strengthen IDPs abilities to identify, respond to and mitigate risks and threats to protection. Approximately 40&#xA0;000 people will be targeted. The project also aims to increase people access to water and sanitation facilities through construction and rehabilitation of waterpoints and improvement of people knowledge and practice of public health and hygiene based on community perceptions. Through cash distribution to highly vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities their essential food needs will be met and their livelihoods strengthened.
IPC Project in CAR and Zimbabwe (3 MSEK)
Specific gaps in country IPC processes have been identified by Oxfam and other stakeholders in Zimbabwe and CAR. Each country has had difficulties with data collection and data quality. In CAR, there are problems with both the quantity and the quality of data available to perform the analyses including a lack of surveys data in some geographic areas and information gaps in the available data (e.g., core food security indicators). In Zimbabwe, the government leads the data collection process and NGOs are invited to participate, but sometimes at short notice and at times with resource contributions to the data collection processes as a prerequisite for participation of agencies in IPC analyses. Large surveys organized by government or UN agencies also tend to crowd out viable sources of information produced by smaller organizations that would otherwise add value and diversity to datasets used in analyses.
This interventions is expected to increase the engagement of NGOs (with a goal of at least 4-6 NGOs participating per country) and support expanded plurality in the consensus-building part of the IPC analysis workshop. Greater transparency will be seen through participation of at least two NGO representatives in the full IPC process:&#xA0; pre-analysis (includes primary data collection and preparation), analysis (e.g., workshops), and post-analysis (communication etc.). The project will consolidate one country-based community of practice of agencies involved in IPC per country (CAR and Zimbabwe).
CaLP (4 MSEK)
The Cash and Voucher Assitance (CVA) landscape is characterized by rapid change and evolving opportunities, both at global and national levels. Technological developments and the changing role of governments, private sector and local actors carry major implications for the role of international humanitarian actors. The amount spent on CVA in humanitarian response has doubled in the past three years. At the same time, overall humanitarian funding has plateaued, meaning that CVA is becoming an increasingly critical part of humanitarian response. The use of CVA has also grown in the COVID-19 response, with the Global Humanitarian Response Plan calling for a scale-up of CVA as an effective way to protect the most vulnerable, as well as reduce the deterioration of assets, livelihoods and social cohesion.
The contribution to CaLP will be in support of CaLPs annual plan (2021-2022). The plan&apos;s strategic focus includes fostering collaboration for more effective and sustainable humanitarian CVA, strengthening evidence-based policy and action in order to transform humanitarian CVA and expanding the skills and knowledge required to deliver quality, sustainable humanitarian CVA, at scale.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam has submitted a proposal for financing to Sida for humanitarian response in the following contexts in 2021: Algeria, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, and Colombia. The proposal includes a request for Oxfam&#x2019;s rapid response mechanism (RRM) and for method and capacity support. 

The contribution will be the first year of a strategic partnership that extends between 2021 and 2025 between Oxfam and Sida&apos;s Humanitarian Unit. The aim of the contribution is to reach people affected by crisis with humanitarian assistance and protection and to contribute to strengthening the capacity of the humanitarian system. All proposed efforts are guided by Oxfam&apos;s core mandate, which is to work with communities before, during and after crises to build their resilience, save lives and tackle the causes of conflict and other disasters.

Oxfam is a global movement of people who are fighting inequality to end poverty and injustice.  Oxfam works in about 70 countries, with partners, and allies. Oxfam GB is one of 20 affiliates that make up the confederation Oxfam International.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This contribution is aimed at supporting Oxfam in selected humanitarian crisis where Oxfam will implement specific projects and where the organisation has a clear added value to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to crisis affected populations.
In 2020 Oxfam launched its new Global Strategic Framework 2020-2030. The framework was developed over a one-year process that involved Oxfam staff and partners across its global confederation. It sets out the overall direction that Oxfam will take in the years to 2030. According to Oxfam, implementation of the framework will be supported by global horizon plans that will set out specific objectives, systemic interventions, and actions. These plans will serve as a roadmaps for measuring progress towards Oxfam&#x2019;s collective ambition. A combination of six approaches is presented in the framework and will constitute Oxfam&#x2019;s overarching theory of change. These include:
A feminist approach- To end all forms of discrimination, injustices and violations of rights suffered by women and gender non-conforming people
People power &#x2013; Amplify the voices and actions of people that experience poverty and injustice and work with those who fight for their causes
Thinking globally and acting locally- Build a coalition within and between regions and from the local to the global
Enhanced humanitarian action- remain committed to delivering life-saving assistance and protection in times of conflict and disaster
Digital rights and space- to engage with and leverage the power and influence of digital technology
Systematic change &#x2013; Mobilize to transform the systems that perpetuate poverty and injustice.
The strategy also outlines Oxfam&#x2019;s approach to enhance its humanitarian actions which involves 1) deliveing life-saving support and assistance to communities affected by conflict and disaster, including people on the move; 2) transforming the systems that contribute to fragility and humanitarian crises;3) helping people and communities develop core competencies to strengthen their resilience; 4) continue to reorient the humanitarian system towards local leadership, and; 5) expanding opportunities for those impacted by protracted conflict and recurring crises to lead on sustainable solutions.
At the operational level the global strategic framework reaffirms Oxfam&#x2019;s commitment to humanitarian assistance in the technical areas of WASH, Economic Inclusion, Cash and social protection based approaches, Gender, Community based protection and safe programming, and finally advocacy work to complement programmes in particular on women in conflict.
In&#xA0;all the technical areas there are four pillars that will inform the humanitarian approach including 1) Community Engagement; 2) Safe Programming; 3) Partnership and Leadership, 4) Feminist approach. Oxfam is currently working on its Horizon Plan for humanitarian action, which will give practical and pragmatic guidance on expectations for Oxfam countries on its humanitarian ambition, how it is changing in approach and alignment of appropriate support.&#xA0;&#xA0;
In 2021/2022 Sida will support Oxfam&#x2019;s humanitarian interventions in 4 different crises as well as its immediate response to new onset crises or rapidly deteriorating situations through the rapid response mechanisms (RRM). The specific objective of each project might differ, but Oxfam&#x2019;s core objective within its humanitarian mandate is to work with communities before, during and after crisis to build their resilience, save lives, and together address the root causes of conflict and disaster. 
Sida will also support a project implemented by Oxfam to improve the use of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis as a tool for ascertaining food insecurity, as well as support to CaLP in order to strengthen the system wide use of CVA as a modality in humanitarian interventions.&#xA0;&#xA0;
The following provides a brief description of the projects objectives and intended results:
Algeria&#xA0;(10 MSEK) &#x2013;&#xA0;Refugees from Western Sahara have been living in 5 refugee camps in Tindouf region, southwestern Algeria since 1975 due to an on-going dispute over the control of the Western Sahara Territory. With no imminent political solution to this protracted crisis in sight, the refugee population is largely dependent on external humanitarian aid for its survival. 94% of refugees remain dependent on humanitarian aid as their primary source of support, including for the provision of food, water and other basic needs.
The intervention aims to&#xA0;strengthen the resilience amongst 133 672 Sahrawi refugees to meet their basic needs, with a focus on food security and water and sanitation. Food security will be improved through the promotion of local agricultural production and distribution of fresh food during challenging summer months. In line with the official UN 5-year WaSH Strategy and Plan, the piped water network in Boujdour camp (which has relied completely on water trucking to date) will be extended, serving as a model which can later be adapted and scaled up in other camps.
Colombia (9 MSEK) -&#xA0; During 2020, refugees and migrants from Venezuela continued arriving in Colombia, with an estimated 1,7 million remaining in the country and half a million in transit to other countries. This situation was further exacerbated by the impact of natural disasters, generalized violence in certain areas, and since March, by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This intervention is part of Oxfam&#xB4;s broad protection strategy to Venezuelan mixed migration flux. It is based on two main components: 1) a strategy to promote sexual and reproductive rights through access to short and medium-term contraceptive methods, accompanied by legal, medical and psychological counselling to manage cases of gender-based violence, and 2) a focused women migrant walkers&apos; program that provides information to tackle risks, reduce vulnerability and strengthen capacities of migrants to avoid risks and mitigate their effects. The project targets approximately 5&#xA0;000 migrants with protection and NFI assistance.
Central African Republic (CAR) (10 MSEK) -&#xA0;Clashes between rebels and government forces in various cities has caused further deterioration of the security situation in CAR since late December 2020, resulting in 105&#xA0;000 new refugees and 100&#xA0;000 new IDPs in the beginning of February 2021. The situation affects the sectors of food security; water, hygiene and sanitation; protection and gender, and particularly affects the prefectures of Ouham, Ouham-Pend&#xE9; and Mbomou in which the project will be implemented.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The proposed intervention will  support women in the textile and footwear industry to withstand the negative impacts of the Covid-19 crisis on their livelihood through  quick-fix solutions to the financial and economic hardship that they face, via cash transfers in the equivalent of three months minumum salary of 26,000 ALL/month plus 4,342 ALL for social security contributions for 407 women workers, and by promoting a more sustainable solution by preparing  the ground for a short-term return to work under safer and improved conditions. The amount to be paid is in line with the GoA measure to cover the wages of the self/employed in micro businesses.

The intervention will develop and disseminate protocols for safe return to work.  ILO will facilitate the negotiation of protocols for measures related to the textile and footwear industry and support design of the national guidelines for occupational health and safety measures. Upon preparation of the protocols and guidelines the ILO will provide technical assistance to ensure that companies have an access to recommended safety and health protection measures during the production (protection instruction and reorganization of production protocols) as well as provision of necessary protection equipment and tools that will be distributed to the companies, as set out in the agreed national guidelines. Thus, the intervention will   implement Occupational Health Standards and new standard operating procedures in 10 selected factories by securing:
&#x2022;	  Effective occupational health and safety OSH staff/committees offering guidance to workers, 
&#x2022;	Putting up signs and posters in the factory that promote good practices on social distancing as well as hygiene and personal protection,
&#x2022;	Making sure that the factory is clean and hygienic (including introduction of physical distancing measures in a workplace and use of disinfectants and personal protective equipment). 
Based on the specific actions planned, the project is expected to have a positive  impact on economic recovery and job protection efforts in response to the COVID-19 crisis.</narrative>

ILO bidrar med teknisk expertis till f&#xF6;retagen s&#xE5; de kan leva upp till dessa f&#xF6;reskrifter samt bidra med skyddsutrustning enligt &#xF6;verenskomna nationella riktlinjer. Insatsen bidrar till genomf&#xF6;rande av yrkes- och h&#xE4;lsostandarder f&#xF6;r 10 utvalda f&#xF6;retag genom att:
-	Utbilda personal inom arbetsrelaterade h&#xE4;lso- och s&#xE4;kerhetsfr&#xE5;gor p&#xE5; 10 f&#xF6;retag;
-	Tydlig skyltning och annan information p&#xE5; fabriksomr&#xE5;det om vikten av att h&#xE5;lla distans, god hygien och s&#xE4;kerhet;
-	St&#xF6;dja god renlighet och hygien p&#xE5; fabrikerna (inklusive inf&#xF6;rande av rutiner f&#xF6;r social distans, anv&#xE4;ndande av skyddsutrustning och disinfektionsmedel etc).

Sammantaget f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas projektet bidra till en ekonomisk &#xE5;terh&#xE4;mtning och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade arbetsf&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llanden efter COVID-19.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
Save the Children Sweden has applied to Sida for funding of 1,5 million SEK for  &quot;Supporting vulnerable and deprived children with educational and protective/hygienic kits&quot; in rural areas of Kosovo during the period 1 October 2020 until 31 January 2021. 

The proposed intervention will focus on approximately 700 families (with approximately 1,400 children and 1,400 adults) who will benefit from educational and protective equipment/hygienic kits directly. 
These families and children live in remote and rural areas -- including children with disabilities, Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian children will be supported with didactic and learning materials as well as technological solutions in order to enable access to learning platforms established by the Ministry of Education in cooperation with Save the Children, UNICEF and other partners. These materials, delivered in the form of care and learning packages through a carefully tailored process, will help vulnerable and disadvantaged children to narrow down the &#x201C;learning gap&#x201D; with their well-to-do peers. The protective/hygienic packages will enable children and their families to protect themselves and others at home and in the community; it will also support children&#x2019;s access to classrooms and other learning environments. 
The Project will organize also awareness-raising activities to inform parents and caretakers &#x2013; including children &#x2013; on positive parenting without violence, sharing up-to-date information about COVID-19 and safety precautions, and by empowering them through targeted psycho-social support activities.</narrative>

Svenska R&#xE4;dda Barnen s&#xF6;ker finansiering fr&#xE5;n Sida om 1,5 miljoner SEK f&#xF6;r att &quot;St&#xF6;dja utsatta och missgynnade barn med utbildning och skydd/hygienkit&quot; p&#xE5; landsbygden i Kosovo under perioden 1 oktober 2020 till och med 31 januari 2021.
Den f&#xF6;reslagna insatsen kommer att fokusera p&#xE5; ca 700 familjer (ca 1400 barn och 1400 vuxna) som kommer att ta del av utbildning och skydd/hygienkit. Insatsen har ett s&#xE4;rskilt fokus p&#xE5; barn med funktionsneds&#xE4;ttning. Insatsen kommer att st&#xE4;rka medvetenheten hos f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ldrar, v&#xE5;rdnadshavare och barn om positivt f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ldraskap utan v&#xE5;ld samt relevant information om COVID-19.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives
The overall of objective of the contribution is increased financial inclusion especially for currently excluded groups (MIPYMES with a special focus on women and young) through the introduction and use of a guarantee fund in the sectors of commerce, production and services.&#xA0;
The contribution is expected to have the indirect impact to increase the formal economy and&#xA0; financial inclusion contributing to economic development, promote green investments and environmentally sustainable businesses.&#xA0;
In parallel the contribution will contribute to the development of new norms in public policy&#xA0; and national financial system that will allow for a more inclusive system with alternative mechanisms developed through the programme. &#xA0;
Theory of Change
Setting up a guarantee fund, and sharing the risk of lending will increase the lending to other social lenders. With an increased capital and guarantee in the back (with set criteria to incentive that target groups are reached) the social lenders will expand their target group, reach more people and new groups such as more micro and small businesses including women and young as well as increase their knowledge of and hopefully aptitude to lend to these groups in the future. Through the guarantee and TA, PROFIN will promote the innovation of financial products adapted for the target groups and by increasing the access to finance micro and small companies will have a higher probability of surviving and prospering in their business, avoiding to have to go through informal channels with unfavourable conditions. In the long term it is expected that the intervention will increase the formality of the economy and decrease the vulnerability of the micro and small enterprises and with a long term impact of more formal jobs and reduced poverty. To ensure that the goal of increased access reaches the identified target groups and that the micro and small enterprises can make the most of it by having solid business plans and payment plans, a strong component of&#xA0; technical assistance and monitoring must accompany the guarantee. PROFIN, already a partner of the Embassy in the Inclusive markets program, will be responsible and agreement partner to the Embassy in this component. This will include a package of financial education at the loan taker level but also articulation between actors to build knowledge and trust at EIF and institutional level towards the target groups as well as advocacy for inclusive financial legal frameworks at national level.
By conditioning the loans to certain environmental and gender standards it is also expected that the intervention will promote a more environmentally sustainable and less discriminatory business climate.&#xA0;
PROFIN is well placed to undertake this responsibility with a strong presence in rural areas, trust (at different levels), experience and innovation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The program aims to increase youth entrepreneurs and youth-led micro, small and medium-sized businesses (&quot;Youth MSMEs&quot;) access to finance and business skills, allowing youth MSMEs to grow and deliver economic performance and a more inclusive economic development in the region. This is expected to contribute to several other social gains such as increased opportunities for employment and income generation and decreased emigration of youth in the Western balkans. The program also entails significant elements that aim to support the recovery following the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. 

Through local partner financial institutions (PFIs), the EBRD will offer credit lines dedicated to youth MSMEs in combination&#xA0;with a first-loss risk cover.&#xA0;Sida funding is proposed to cover the capacity building component of the program which will be made up of technical&#xA0;assistance to the PFIs and also access to know-how aimed at participating youth entrepreneurs, in the form of business advisory support, business development and networking opportunities. Specific trainings on digitization, value chain management and environmental sustainability will be included as a response to needs emerged during the current pandemic.Important elements to note in the proposed intervention are also the regional exchange and networking that will be promoted, as well as the intent to engage with local organizations with mandates related to youth entrepreneurship.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Nya medel/medeltill&#xE4;gg f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
Den f&#xF6;reslagna insatsen syftar till att &#xF6;ka tillg&#xE5;ng till finansiering och st&#xE4;rkt kapacitet hos unga entrepren&#xF6;rer och mikro-, sm&#xE5; och medelstora f&#xF6;retag  (MSMEs) ledda av unga personer. Detta f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till att MSMEs ledda av unga m&#xE4;nniskor kan v&#xE4;xa, leverera ekonomiska resultat och bidra till en mer inkluderande ekonomisk utveckling i regionen. Detta f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas ocks&#xE5; leda till flera andra sociala vinster, s&#xE5;som &#xF6;kad syssels&#xE4;ttning bland unga, &#xF6;kade m&#xF6;jligheter till f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning och minskad emigration bland den unga befolkningen p&#xE5; v&#xE4;stra Balkan. Programmet syftar ocks&#xE5; till att underl&#xE4;tta &#xE5;terh&#xE4;mtningen efter den ekonomiska kris som orsakats av Covid-19. 

Genom lokala finansiella partnerorganisationer (PFI) kommer EBRD att erbjuda krediter som &#xE4;r avsedda f&#xF6;r MSME ledda av ugna personer, i kombination med en risk &quot;first loss risk-cover&quot; garanti. Sidas finansiering syftar till att t&#xE4;cka de delar av insatsen som g&#xE4;ller kapacitetsutveckling i form av TA till PFI samt utbildning som riktar sig till deltagande unga entrepren&#xF6;rer i form av aff&#xE4;rsr&#xE5;dgivning, aff&#xE4;rsutveckling och n&#xE4;tverksm&#xF6;jligheter. S&#xE4;rskilt fokus l&#xE4;ggs &#xE4;ven p&#xE5; utbildning inom digitalisering, hantering av v&#xE4;rdekedjor och &quot;gr&#xF6;n omst&#xE4;llning&quot;, f&#xF6;r att svara upp mot de stora behov som finns efter r&#xE5;dande pandemi.

Viktiga delar att notera i det f&#xF6;reslagna insatsen &#xE4;r ocks&#xE5; det regionala utbyte och n&#xE4;tverksbyggande aktiviteter som kommer att fr&#xE4;mjas, liksom avsikten att samarbeta med lokala organisationer med mandat relaterade till unga och entrepren&#xF6;rskap/f&#xF6;retagande.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sida will support United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF) in&#xA0;Somalia with thematic funding for Health and Protective Environment, with an additional support to the Covid vaccination campagin. The contribution has the overall objective to contribute to:

- That more newborns, infants and children survive and thrive, and fewer women and girls die during pregnancy and childbirth.
- That children and women are safer and better protected from violence, exploitation, abuse and harm.

The proposed contribution will contribute to the following objectives in the Strategy for Sweden&#x2019;s development cooperation with Somalia 2018&#x2013;2022:
- Greater and equitable access to health and medical care, focusing on women 
and children;
- Strengthened systems and institutions that promote and guarantee respect 
for human rights, democracy and the rule of law; and
-  Strengthened capacity to prevent and counter violent extremism and radicalisation.

Sida will contribute with 75 million SEK over the period 2021-2022 to the thematic areas, health, including an earmarked support to the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign, and protective environment, as stated in UNICEF&apos;s Country Programme for Somalia 2021-2025. During the same period UNICEF proposes to implement the equivalent of 520 million SEK from regular and other resources to the same thematic programmes.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The contribution is focused on two areas: health and protective environment
Health: 
UNICEF states that the overall purpose of its support to Somalia&#x2019;s health programming is to ensure that more children aged 0-18 years and women benefit from quality comprehensive health services and healthy life practices.
Programming will, UNICEF informs, therefore focus on strengthening evidence-based planning, budgeting and monitoring for maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent health (MNCAH), improving quality MNCAH services as well as family care practices for health and nutrition and institutionalizing community health approaches.
As part of Somalia&#x2019;s strategy, to reduce neonatal mortality, UNICEF&#xA0;aims &#x2013; with the contribution from Sida - to provide continued support to evidence-based low-cost high impact interventions to mothers and babies to reduce new-born mortality and still births.
UNICEF support includes trainings of midwives, nurses and doctors on early essential new-born care, which UNICEF with Sida support seeks to roll out in two federal member states: Hirshabelle and South West States.
Complemented with supplies and equipment, competency-based training will - according to UNICEF - target health professionals, primarily midwives, nurses and doctors from regional hospitals, health centres and peripheral health units (PHUs) to deliver quality interventions for pregnant and lactating women and their babies.
In terms of actual activities, UNICEF&#xA0;states that these are derived from the essential package of health services (EPHS) with primary focus to establish quality care targeting pregnant and lactating women and their babies using community, health facility and mobile clinic platforms.
This includes:
-Cascade (already prepared) various forms of&#xA0;competency-based training to build skills and knowledge of health professionals (midwives/nurses/doctors) and other front-line health cadres (e.g. community health workers).
-Provision of new-born care and other related mother and new-born supplies and materials.
-Monthly performance monitoring meetings to review indicator trends.
-Complementary resources to NGO partners in targeted areas to accelerate mother and new-born health service delivery, emergency referral and community accountability mechanisms (e.g., community health committees).
-Develop an integrated health and nutrition &#x201C;first pregnancy&#x201D; strategy for UNICEF; and, conduct a detailed assessment and roadmap for gradually supporting the state MOHs to manage managing their own cold chain to enable deliver safe, effective vaccines.
-Prepare contingency plans, capacity development and pre-positioning of supplies to enable the different&#xA0;state ministry of health&#xA0;to prepare and respond to regular cyclical shocks (floods, drought)- given chronic humanitarian needs (annual cyclical shocks) affecting the two states.
Examples of indicators that will measure progress and results for Health:
- Percentage of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel
- Percentage of pregnant women who attended at least four times for antenatal care during their pregnancy
- Percentage of children under 1 year receiving measles-containing vaccine
Protective environment:
The humanitarian crisis in Somalia is among the most complex and longstanding emergencies in the world. The protective environment for children has been weakened due to more than two decades of conflict resulting in the collapse of institutions at all levels. The perpetration of grave child rights violations including the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups remains a major concern in Somalia.
Under the programme for protective environment&#xA0;UNICEF will provide technical support to the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development and the Ministry of Justice to develop an effective child protection system. UNICEF will support the Government in accelerating the domestication of the Convention on the Rights of the Child through building a stronger legislative and policy environment. The Child Protection Information Management System will be rolled out nationwide, providing case management tools that reinforce accountable services and follow-up.
UNICEF will furthermore in the area of child protection/protective environment:
-Strengthen the protective environment for girls and boys in school.
-Support children affected by armed conflict (including maintenance of the monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave child rights violations).
More specifically, the contribution will help to support the retention of girls and boys in school by contributing to a wider safe schools initiative that is being developed between the UNICEF education and child protection teams.
The broader program includes the development of school councils, teacher codes of conduct, improved pre- and in-service teacher training, higher female teacher ratios, as well as empowerment self-defence and &quot;your moment of truth&quot; violence prevention norm change programming for students.
Examples of indicators that will measure progress and results for Protective Environment:
-&#xA0;Outcome indicator: Number of schools and adolescent students (by sex) engaged in a safe schools&#x2019; programme incorporating adolescent empowerment
-&#xA0;Outcome indicator: % of girls and boys recruited and used by armed forces and groups that have been released and reintegrated with their families and provided with adequate care and services
For both Health and Protective Environment&#xA0;UNICEF&#xA0;has provided a results framework with indicators, baseline and targets&#xA0;allowing for a results oriented approach and close follow-up and dialogue on the progress of implementation. Examples of those is presented above under each thematic area.&#xA0;
COVAX&#xA0;vaccines and the roll out&#xA0;of Covid-19 vaccination campaign&#xA0;
The first batch of COVAX vaccines (300 000 doses) arrived to Somalia on March 15, 2021. &#xA0;The Covid-19 vaccination campaign is&#xA0;of vital importance as a critical public health intervention&#xA0;to help contain further spread especially amongst the vulnerable populations.
The COVAX facility will provide vaccines for 20% of Somalia&apos;s total population. In this regard, Somalia will receive vaccines to cover 3,134,106 individuals, taking into consideration the population of Somalia being approximately 15,670,529 persons. Each eligible individual will receive 2 doses of the vaccine so, meaning that 6,268,212 million doses are expected to be administrated.&#xA0;&#xA0;
In close collaboration with the Federal and State Ministries of Health,&#xA0;UNICEF&#xA0;and WHO developed a plan and budget to cover for the operational costs for the vaccination campaign. To cover the operational costs for the 6,2 million&#xA0;doses that are expected, it is calculated to cost approximately 25 MUSD, or per doses administrated 4 USD.
The plan developed includes the following key activities&#xA0;planning and coordination, logistics and vaccine management; human resources; training and meetings; supplies and equipment; transportation; social mobilization and communication; and M&amp;amp;E tools and biometric data collection; intra- and post-campaign monitoring; AEFI (adverse events following immunization) surveillance; and other forms of necessary technical support.&#xA0;&#xA0;
The expected outcome of the Covid-19 campaign is vaccine induced immunity to protect against&#xA0;Covid-19, which will protect vulnerable groups and detain further spread of the virus. The proposed 5 million SEK&#xA0;will cover full vaccination (2 doses) of approximately&#xA0;74 000 Somalis.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Diaspora Investment Partnership f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas aktivera diasporainvesteringar och bidra till att st&#xE4;rka n&#xE4;tverk, med det l&#xE5;ngsiktiga m&#xE5;let att bidra till h&#xE5;llbar finansiering och kapital f&#xF6;r nystartade f&#xF6;retag och MSME-f&#xF6;retag i syfte att skapa nya arbetstillf&#xE4;llen och bidra till st&#xE4;rkt entrepren&#xF6;rskapacitet och h&#xE5;llbar utveckling i utvecklingsl&#xE4;nder. Initiativet kommer att testas under en pilotfas. Piloten kommer att fokusera p&#xE5; Kenya men aktiviteter som avser analys och partnerskap kommer &#xE4;ven att genomf&#xF6;ras i Somalia och Etiopien. En eventuell uppskalning avser &#xE4;ven fullst&#xE4;ndig pilot i Somalia och Etiopien (dvs design och test av digital plattform).  

Hypotesen &#xE4;r att det finns en informationsasymmetri och ett behov av att utveckla mer formella strukturer f&#xF6;r att m&#xE4;kla investerarrelationer mellan diasporan (samt diasporans bredare n&#xE4;tverk) och MSME:er och nystartade f&#xF6;retag p&#xE5; ett h&#xE5;llbart och effektivt s&#xE4;tt. F&#xF6;r att fylla detta behov kr&#xE4;vs det inte bara att villiga investerare inom diasporan f&#xE5;r tillg&#xE5;ng till information om m&#xF6;jliga f&#xF6;retag att investera i, utan &#xE4;ven en f&#xF6;rs&#xE4;kran om att potentiella investeringsobjekt har genomg&#xE5;tt en viss bakgrundskontroll och l&#xF6;nsamhetsvalidering. Detta b&#xF6;r ske i en riskfri och transparent milj&#xF6; d&#xE4;r risk kan spridas mellan flera investerare. P&#xE5; s&#xE5; s&#xE4;tt f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas befintliga informationsasymmetrier brytas ner och marknadsutmaningar &#xF6;verkommas.

Initiativet &#xE4;r ett pilotprojekt och Sidas bidrag p&#xE5; 4 850 000 MSEK kommer att anv&#xE4;ndas f&#xF6;r att minska risken och m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra f&#xF6;r innovation, design och test av tekniska l&#xF6;sningar och verktyg, samt utveckling av nya former av samarbeten och partnerskap. Initiativet kommer att l&#xF6;pa &#xF6;ver en 12-m&#xE5;nadersperiod varefter det finns en potential att, givet att projektet n&#xE5;r framg&#xE5;ng, skala upp initiativet till fler l&#xE4;nder och diasporagrupper.

Pangea Trust kommer att vara Sidas implementeringspartner. Pangea Trusts &#xF6;vergripande mission &#xE4;r att p&#xE5;skynda och bidra till att skapa f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar f&#xF6;r afrikanska entrepren&#xF6;rer att utveckla sin kompetens och f&#xE5; tillg&#xE5;ng till relevanta n&#xE4;tverk och kapital f&#xF6;r att n&#xE5; sin fulla potential. Pangea Trust har kunskap om och en lokal n&#xE4;rvaro p&#xE5; pilotmarknaden, tillg&#xE5;ng till relevanta lokala och regionala strategiska partner (att engagera direkt och/eller som tysta partners) och ett etablerat n&#xE4;tverk inom den nordiska diasporan. Detta anses vara en f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttning f&#xF6;r att kunna utveckla f&#xF6;reslagna digitala plattformar som ska bryta ned den informationsasymmetri som anses utg&#xF6;ra ett huvudsakligt utvecklingshinder. D&#xE4;rut&#xF6;ver f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas den digitala plattformen tj&#xE4;na syftet att katalysera ytterligare investeringar. Sida har ambitionen att bana v&#xE4;g f&#xF6;r en global uppskalning och vill undvika att projektet endast leder till ytterligare ett frist&#xE5;ende initiativ.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Diaspora Investment Partnership initiative is expected to activate diaspora remittances and networks with the long-term goal to contribute to sustainable sources of financing and capital for start-ups and MSMEs to drive job creation and enhance entrepreneurial capacity and sustainable development opportunities in developing countries. The initiative will be tested during a pilot phase. The pilot will focus on Kenya but activities, including analysis and partnership, will also be implemented in Somalia and Ethiopia. A potential scaling-up will also include the full pilot in Somalia Ethiopia (i.e. design and test of digital platform). 

The hypothesis is that there is an information asymmetry and a need to develop more formal and structured means of connecting MSMEs and start-ups that require capital and financing with the diaspora and their networks in a sustainable and effective manner. Not only should the diaspora have the means to easily access information regarding potential businesses in which to invest, but they should also receive the necessary assurances that the businesses in which they would invest have undergone some background check and viability validation. This would be done in a de-risked and transparent environment, where risk is spread across multiple investments, thereby breaking down the potential information asymmetries and market challenges.

The project will take the form of a pilot, and Sida&#x2019;s contribution of MSEK 4 850 000 will be used to de-risk the initiative, as well as to enable design, innovation and testing of technical solutions and tools. The project will also explore new forms of collaboration and partnerships. The pilot will cover a 12-month period after which there is potential to, if the initiative proves successful, scale to more countries and diasporas.

The Pangea Trust will be Sida&#x2019;s implementing partner. The overall mission of Pangea Trust is to accelerate and contribute to the creation of an enabling environment, where African entrepreneurs can develop competences and gain access to relevant networks and capital in order to reach their full potential. By leveraging (1) Pangea Trust&#xB4;s knowledge of and presence in the pilot&#x2019;s target market(s), (2) their providing access to relevant local and regional strategic partners (to become engaged directly and/or as silent partners), as well as (3) an already established network within the Nordic diaspora, the platforms are expected to not only break down the information asymmetry, but also to mitigate attendant risks. In effect, the initiative is expected to hold the potential to catalyse more diaspora investments through an eventual crowding-in effect. Sida has a long-term ambition to pave the way for a global scale-up rather than creating another stand-alone initiative.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is important to understand both the short-term and immediate expected outputs from the 12-month pilot phase and long-term development outcomes and impact intended to be supported, would the initiative prove successful and scaled-up.
The 12-month initiative entails four separate but interlinked outputs. The initial idea presented by Pangea Trust was centred at the development and piloting of two digital solutions (technical platforms) to &#x201C;improve the deployment of diaspora remittances and networks to provide investment capital for MSMEs and start-ups&#x201D; and to &#x201C;develop solutions within Islamic financing to improve financial inclusion for this demography and mobilize financial recourses from those in the diaspora to which such instruments speak, based on their religion&#x201D;. During the dialogue and further elaboration of the project idea, Sida proposed to also include activities related to a &#x201C;diaspora mapping&#x201D; and the &#x201C;development of institutional partnership solutions&#x201D;, seeking to understand better the underlying constraints, success triggers and how coordination and value addition to other similar initiatives can be secured, including also programs and partners already receiving Swedish or other funding/support in the pilot countries.
The Sida funding during the 12-months pilot phase is MSEK 4 850 000. The catalytic potential of the initiative is considered high. The monetary leverage during the initial phase is estimated at 1:1 in investments and donations mobilized. The long-term monetary leverage is expected to be much higher as well as other potential long-term results related to MSME development and job creation.
The covid-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic drop in remittances. This initiative presents an opportunity for Sida to contribute to the development of sustainable digital solutions mobilising capital for development from and in collaboration with the diaspora. Targeted digitalization of services will bridge a gap between the diaspora and investment opportunities (SME) in diaspora groups&apos; home countries. By this intervention Sida will contribute to the development of digital solutions with high potential to be scaled up to global level, by duplication and sharing of digital code (as a global good) and communication platforms.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
HiiL has applied to Sida for funding of 11,853,000SEK to implement a programme titled &quot; People  Centred Justice- Justice Innovations in a Pandemic  for one (1) year.

The programme aims to increase the number of solutions for people in Uganda that prevent or resolve their most pressing justice problems during Covid-times (more people-centered justice).

The programme will achieve the above goal through working towards achieving three specific outcomes namely;
1.  Enhanced access to and use of information and data for/by various justice stakeholders in Uganda on Covid-related justice problems.
2.  Increased access to and use of justice solutions for people in Uganda in a pandemic.
3. Increased agreement and dialogue amongst JLOS and Ugandan justice leaders on the enabling environment for people centred-justice in a pandemic.

The programme consists of three components namely i) Justice Research and Development, ii) Justice Innovations and  iii)Justice Leadership Transformation. Under each of these components HiiL will conduct activities as follows;

1. Justice Research and Development
 HiiL will  develop and conduct a quick e-survey of justice needs and response strategies during the Covid-19 crisis,  it will work together with justice experts in Uganda to develop and monitor outcomes  that people aim to achieve when they seek justice during the pandemic and  updating the previously developed family justice catalogue to reflect challenges arising during Covid-19 pandemic. 

2. Justice Innovations
HiiL will  improve the local services that are most often used by the population, such as the LCCs and a number of other innovative services. Connecting the LCCs and innovative services with the services by the courts, thus creating effective integration between formal and informal justice, where possible supported online to quickly address justice challenges caused by and during the Covi9 19 pandemic. The innovative approaches will be designed in line with the findings of the e-survey on justice needs during the pandemic.

Additionally, HiiL will provide its previous innovators with seed funding to develop innovations but to also shield the innovators from the business challenges that have been caused by Covid-19 that could lead to their collapse. 

3. Justice Transformation
HiiL will bring together a broad representation of justice leaders to develop pathways that look at organisational and financial systems, laws and regulations, and ways of working that are needed to address challenges arising during the pandemic.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Nya medel/medeltill&#xE4;gg f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
The Hague Institute of Innovation in Law (HiiL) har ans&#xF6;kt till Sida om finansiering om SEK 11 853 000 f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra programmet &quot;People-Centred Justice - Justice Innovations in a Pandemic&#x201D; f&#xF6;r ett &#xE5;r.

Programmet syftar till att &#xF6;ka och bredda tillg&#xE5;ngen till olika former av tvistel&#xF6;sningsmekanismer f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nniskor i Uganda, s&#xE5; att de mest akuta r&#xE4;ttsliga problemen kan l&#xF6;sas, &#xE4;ven under de f&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llanden som r&#xE5;der under pandemin. HiiL verkar f&#xF6;r en mer individ-orienterad r&#xE4;ttvisa (People-centred justice).

Det &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;let avses n&#xE5;s genom att arbeta f&#xF6;r att uppn&#xE5; tre specifika utfall (outcomes) n&#xE4;mligen;
1. F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad tillg&#xE5;ng till och anv&#xE4;ndning av information och data f&#xF6;r och av olika akt&#xF6;rer inom r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE4;sendet i Uganda ang&#xE5;ende Covid-relaterade r&#xE4;ttsliga problem.
2. &#xD6;kad tillg&#xE5;ng till och anv&#xE4;ndning av r&#xE4;ttsliga l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nniskor i Uganda under en pandemi.
3. &#xD6;kad enighet och dialog mellan JLOS och ledare inom ugandiska r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE4;sendet ang&#xE5;ende en m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;rande milj&#xF6; f&#xF6;r en s.k. individ-orienterad r&#xE4;ttvisa i en pandemi.
Programmet best&#xE5;r av tre delar, n&#xE4;mligen i) r&#xE4;ttslig forskning och utveckling, ii) r&#xE4;ttsliga innovationer och iii) ledarskap och f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring inom r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE4;sendet. Under var och en av dessa komponenter kommer Hiil att bedriva verksamhet enligt f&#xF6;ljande;

1. R&#xE4;ttslig forskning och utveckling
 HiiL kommer att utveckla och genomf&#xF6;ra en online-unders&#xF6;kning ang&#xE5;ende r&#xE4;ttsliga behov och strategier som till&#xE4;mpas f&#xF6;r att bem&#xF6;ta dessa behov under Covid-19-krisen. R&#xE4;ttsexperter medverkar i programmet f&#xF6;r att utveckla och &#xF6;vervaka de resultat som m&#xE4;nniskor syftar till att uppn&#xE5; n&#xE4;r de s&#xF6;ker r&#xE4;ttvisa under pandemin. Den tidigare utvecklade handboken f&#xF6;r familjer&#xE4;tt uppdateras f&#xF6;r att &#xE5;terspegla de utmaningar som uppst&#xE5;r under Covid-19-pandemin.
 
2. R&#xE4;ttsliga innovationer
HiiL avser st&#xE4;rka och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra de lokala r&#xE4;ttstj&#xE4;nster som oftast anv&#xE4;nds av befolkningen, s&#xE5;som t.ex. Local District Courts (LCC). Att koppla samman LCCs och innovativa tj&#xE4;nster med de befintliga domstolarna kan leda till en konstruktiv integrering av olika former av formell och informell r&#xE4;ttvisa. De innovativa metoderna kommer att utformas i linje med resultaten av online-unders&#xF6;kningen om r&#xE4;ttsliga behov under pandemin.

HiiL kommer &#xE4;ven att f&#xF6;rse sina tidigare innovat&#xF6;rer med grundfinansiering (seed-funding) f&#xF6;r att utveckla innovationer, men ocks&#xE5; f&#xF6;r att st&#xF6;dja de innovat&#xF6;rerna som de tidigare st&#xF6;tt i att bem&#xF6;ta aff&#xE4;rsutmaningar som har orsakats av Covid-19, utmaningar vilka annars riskerar leda till deras kollaps. 

3. Ledarskap och f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring inom r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE4;sendet
HiiL kommer att sammanf&#xF6;ra en bred representation av ledare inom r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE4;sendet f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra en vidareutveckling av organisatoriska och finansiella system, lagar och f&#xF6;rordningar, samt arbetss&#xE4;tt som beh&#xF6;vs f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta utmaningar som uppst&#xE5;r under pandemin.</narrative>

The Embassy considers that the outcomes and objectives are clear and in line with mandate and comparative advantages of UNFPA. The Embassy also considers that the outcomes and objectives are relevant for the Malian&apos;s context i.e among others the lack of basic social services, weak supply-chain regarding the family planning, gender-based violence including harmful tradional practices.&#xA0;These objectives will be pursued in stable as well as in humanitarian context.
1- Sexual and reproductive health
Output 1: Strengthened national capacities to ensure a continuum of highquality essential and emergency obstetric and newborn care for women, adolescents and youth and other vulnerable groups, including those in the humanitarian settings. 
Output 2: Strengthened national capacities to improve supply-chain management and demand for family planning services for women, youth and adolescents, including in humanitarian settings
2- Adolescents and youth
Output : Young people and adolescents, particularly adolescent girls, have improved life skills for informed decision-making, especially in sexual and reproductive health, leadership, commitment and participation in peacebuilding, including in humanitarian contexts.
3- Gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment
Output : Strengthened national capacities, communities and civil society organizations in promoting gender equality, women&#x2019;s empowerment, prevention and care of gender-based violence and other harmful practices, including in humanitarian settings.
4- Population dynamics
Output: The capacities of national statistical systems are strengthened for the production and use of high-quality disaggregated data for policy formulation and monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals to harness the demographic dividend, including in humanitarian contexts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">UNFPA har ans&#xF6;kt hos ambassaden om finansiering p&#xE5; 60 miljoner kronor f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra sitt &quot;Landsprogramsdokument&quot; (Country Program Document) f&#xF6;r 2020-2024 i Mali.

Detta bidrag &#xE4;r avsett att st&#xF6;dja UNFPA: s landskontor i Mali inom fyra resultatomr&#xE5;den med fem formulerade m&#xE5;l som presenteras nedan. Dessa m&#xE5;l kommer att efterstr&#xE4;vas i b&#xE5;de stabila och humanit&#xE4;ra sammanhang.

1- Sexuell och reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa
Resultat 1: St&#xE4;rkt nationell kapacitet f&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla ett kontinuerligt behov av h&#xF6;gkvalitativ och akut obstetrisk och nyf&#xF6;dd v&#xE5;rd f&#xF6;r kvinnor, ungdomar och ungdomar och andra utsatta grupper, inklusive de i humanit&#xE4;ra milj&#xF6;er.
Resultat 2: St&#xE4;rkt nationell kapacitet f&#xF6;r att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra hanteringen av tillg&#xE5;ng och efterfr&#xE5;gan p&#xE5; familjeplaneringstj&#xE4;nster f&#xF6;r kvinnor, ungdomar och unga vuxna, &#xE4;ven i humanit&#xE4;ra milj&#xF6;er

2- Ungdomar och unga vuxna
Resultat: Ungdomar och unga vuxna, s&#xE4;rskilt ton&#xE5;riga flickor, har f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade livskunskaper f&#xF6;r informerat beslutsfattande, s&#xE4;rskilt inom sexuell och reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa, ledarskap, engagemang och deltagande i fredsbyggande, inklusive i humanit&#xE4;ra sammanhang.

3- J&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet och kvinnors egenmakt (empowerment)
Resultat: St&#xE4;rkt nationell kapacitet, inom samh&#xE4;llen och civilsamh&#xE4;llesorganisationer f&#xF6;r att fr&#xE4;mja j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet, kvinnors egenmakt, f&#xF6;rebyggande och omh&#xE4;ndertagande av k&#xF6;nsbaserat v&#xE5;ld och andra skadliga metoder, inklusive i humanit&#xE4;ra milj&#xF6;er.

4- Befolkningsdynamik
Resultat: Kapaciteten hos nationella statistiksystem st&#xE4;rks f&#xF6;r framtagande och anv&#xE4;ndning av h&#xF6;gkvalitativa uppdelade data f&#xF6;r policyformulering, samt f&#xF6;r att uppf&#xF6;ljning av m&#xE5;len f&#xF6;r h&#xE5;llbar utveckling som gagnar de demografiska skillnaderna, &#xE4;ven i humanit&#xE4;ra sammanhang.

Programmet kommer att implementeras genom UNFPA: s huvudkontor i Bamako, med st&#xF6;d av ett underkontor, &#xF6;ppnat i Mopti, som verkar i de centrala och norra regionerna vilka drabbats av den humanit&#xE4;ra krisen. Regionerna &#xE4;r prioriterade i den humanit&#xE4;ra insatsplanen och av regeringen inom konfliktl&#xF6;sning, fred och utveckling. Statliga organ s&#xE5;v&#xE4;l som civilsamh&#xE4;llesorganisationer kommer att ing&#xE5; i implementeringen.

Insatsens totala budget &#xE4;r 46,1 miljoner USD, varav organisationens egen finansiering &#xE4;r cirka 12,1 miljoner USD  och 34 miljoner USD genom samfinansieringsmetoder eller andra k&#xE4;llor. Med Covid-19-pandemin samt den f&#xF6;rs&#xE4;mrade sociala och humanit&#xE4;ra krisen har behoven &#xF6;kat vilket leder till ett behov av 63,5 miljoner USD. Fr&#xE5;n den senaste siffran ber&#xE4;knas finansieringsgapet till 26 miljoner USD. Det svenska bidraget p&#xE5; 60 MSEK motsvarar 27% av det identifierade finansiella gapet som n&#xE4;mns ovan.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNFPA has applied to Embassy for funding of 60 million SEK to carry out its 2020-2024 &quot;Country Program Document&quot; in Mali. 

This contribution is intended to support the&#xA0;UNFPA Mali country office in contributing to four outcome areas with five articulated objectives as presented below. These objectives will be pursued in stable as well as in humanitarian context.

1- Sexual and reproductive health
Output 1: Strengthened national capacities to ensure a continuum of highquality essential and emergency obstetric and newborn care for women, adolescents and youth and other vulnerable groups, including those in the humanitarian settings.
Output 2: Strengthened national capacities to improve supply-chain management and demand for family planning services for women, youth and adolescents, including in humanitarian settings
2- Adolescents and youth
Output : Young people and adolescents, particularly adolescent girls, have improved life skills for informed decision-making, especially in sexual and reproductive health, leadership, commitment and participation in peacebuilding, including in humanitarian contexts.
3- Gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment
Output : Strengthened national capacities, communities and civil society organizations in promoting gender equality, women&#x2019;s empowerment, prevention and care of gender-based violence and other harmful practices, including in humanitarian settings.
4- Population dynamics
Output: The capacities of national statistical systems are strengthened for the production and use of high-quality disaggregated data for policy formulation and monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals to harness the demographic dividend, including in humanitarian contexts.

The program will be implemented through the UNFPA main office in Bamako, supported by a sub office, opened in Mopti, to serve the central and northern regions affected by the humanitarian crisis and prioritized in the Humanitarian Response Plan and by the Government for conflict resolution, peace and development. Government entities as well as Civil Society Organizations will be part of the implementers.

The intervention&#x2019;s total budget is 46,1 million USD, out of which the organization&#x2019;s own funding is approximately  12,1 million USD from its regular resources and 34 million USD through co-financing modalities or other sources.  With the COVID-19 pandemic, the worsening of social and humanitarian crisis, the needs have increased leading to a need of 63.5 million USD. From this latest figure, the funding gap is estimated at 26 million USD. The Swedish contribution of 60 MSEK corresponds to 27% of the identified financial gap mentioned above.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">I Bosnien och Hercegovina (BiH) spelar bostadssektorn stor roll f&#xF6;r energif&#xF6;rbrukningen. Bostadssektorn bed&#xF6;ms &#xE4;ven vara sektorn med st&#xF6;rst potential f&#xF6;r kostnadseffektiva energibesparingar. Den genomsnittliga &#xE5;rliga energif&#xF6;rbrukningen f&#xF6;r bostadshus i BiH &#xE4;r mer &#xE4;n fem g&#xE5;nger st&#xF6;rre &#xE4;n genomsnittet f&#xF6;r bostadshus i EU-l&#xE4;nder. 

Det prim&#xE4;ra projektm&#xE5;let &#xE4;r att skapa en grund/&#xF6;ppna upp f&#xF6;r &#xF6;kade investeringar i koldioxidsn&#xE5;la bostadsbyggnader i BiH. Denna f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring inom energisektorn kan dock endast ske om kapaciteten och kunskapen inom relevanta institutioner och bland tj&#xE4;nstem&#xE4;n st&#xE4;rks. Detta b&#xF6;r ske parallellt med etableringen av ett system som m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r finansieringen av projekt inom energieffektivitet och infrastruktur, samtidigt som det bidrar till &#x201D;gr&#xF6;n&#x201D; syssels&#xE4;ttning och reducerar koldioxidutsl&#xE4;ppen. Detta tre&#xE5;riga projekt (2021-2024) kommer att lanseras i 36 kommuner och st&#xE4;der. Det svenska st&#xF6;det kommer att signifikant bidra till utveckling av finansiella mekanismer i kommunerna, f&#xF6;r &#xF6;kad energieffektivitet i bostadsbyggnader. Detta kommer att uppn&#xE5;s genom tre kompletterande aktiviteter:

Aktivitet 1: Genomf&#xF6;ra energieffektivitetsstudier av bostadsbyggnader i de 36 deltagande kommunerna/st&#xE4;derna. 
Aktivitet 2: Utveckla &#xF6;vergripande kommunala finans- och policymekanismer f&#xF6;r implementeringen av energieffektivitets&#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder, b&#xE5;de under projektets g&#xE5;ng och efter&#xE5;t.  
Aktivitet 3: Fr&#xE4;mja kampanjer och allm&#xE4;nna utbildningar f&#xF6;r att &#xF6;ka befolkningens medvetande och kunskap om f&#xF6;rdelarna med energieffektivitet.  

Projektet &#xE4;mnar ta itu med policyhinder som investerare i koldioxidsn&#xE5;la byggnader och infrastruktur m&#xF6;ter. Detta genom att st&#xF6;dja utvecklingen och implementeringen av nya policyramverk. Projektet kommer ocks&#xE5;, i samarbete med lokala och internationella finansiella institutioner, att bidra till tillg&#xE4;ngligg&#xF6;ra gr&#xF6;n och kostnadseffektiv energifinansiering. 
Projektet &#xE4;mnar ocks&#xE5; bidra till &#x201D;gr&#xF6;n &#xE5;terh&#xE4;mtning&#x201D; efter COVID. Detta genom att tillhandah&#xE5;lla teknisk och ekonomisk stimulans till minskade utsl&#xE4;pp av v&#xE4;xthusgaser (GHG), b&#xE4;ttre luftkvalitet, nya jobb och till budgetbesparingar/generering av resurser f&#xF6;r investeringar etc.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the residential sector plays a significant role in final energy consumption and is also recognized as the sector with the largest potential for cost-effective energy savings. The average energy consumption in residential buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina is over five times more than the specific annual energy consumption in residential buildings in EU countries.

The primary goal of the project is to build foundations/open the floor for scaling-up investment in low-carbon residential buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This transformational change in energy sector can only happen if the capacity and skills of the relevant institutions and professionals are strengthened in parallel with establishment of the system that enables financing for energy efficiency infrastructure projects while generating green jobs and reducing CO2 emissions. This three-year project (2021 - 2024) will be launched with 36 cities and municipalities. Sweden&#x2019;s involvement will significantly contribute to accelerating the development of municipal financial mechanisms for the implementation of energy efficiency measures on residential buildings. This will be achieved through 3 interlinked activities, namely: 
Activity 1: Create energy efficiency studies of residential sector in each of 36 participating Municipality/City 
Activity 2: Develop overall Municipal/City financial and policy mechanisms for implementation of energy efficiency measures under this project and beyond 
Activity 3: Facilitate public awareness-raising campaign and citizens&apos; education in win-win energy efficiency benefits 

The project plans to address policy barriers faced by investors into low-carbon buildings and infrastructure by supporting the development and implementation of enabling policy framework. In partnership with a local and international financial institutions, the project will facilitate access to green energy finance at affordable terms. 

The project will also contribute to COVID-19 &#x201C;green recovery&#x201D; by providing technical and economic stimulus to GHG emission reduction, air quality improvement, creation of new jobs, budgetary savings/ re-generating resources for investment etc.</narrative>

Mo&#xE7;ambique &#xE4;r ett av v&#xE4;rldens fattigaste l&#xE4;nder och ett av de mest utsatta l&#xE4;nderna i Afrika f&#xF6;r klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar. Majoriteten av Mo&#xE7;ambiques befolkning bor p&#xE5; landsbygden och &#xE4;r beroende av sm&#xE5;skaligt sj&#xE4;lvhush&#xE5;llslantbruk f&#xF6;r att f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rja sig. Klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringarna utg&#xF6;r d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r ett stort hot mot m&#xE4;nniskors livsmedelsf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning. Under 2016 och 2017 utsattes Mo&#xE7;ambique f&#xF6;r b&#xE5;de torka och &#xF6;versv&#xE4;mningar och under 2019 drabbades landet av tv&#xE5; cykloner som f&#xF6;rst&#xF6;rde b&#xE5;de sk&#xF6;rdar och infrastruktur. 

De sm&#xE5;skaliga lantbrukarna har &#xF6;verlag mycket l&#xE5;g kapacitet att skydda sig mot klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringarnas effekter, vilka v&#xE4;ntas &#xF6;ka i styrka och frekvens i Mo&#xE7;ambique. Det &#xE4;r d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r viktigt att arbeta f&#xF6;rebyggande f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka motst&#xE5;ndskraften inf&#xF6;r klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringarna.

F&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ra utmaningarna som st&#xE4;lls p&#xE5; klimatanpassning och modernisering f&#xF6;resl&#xE5;s programmet &quot;FAR II: Livsmedelss&#xE4;kerhet genom klimatanpassning och resiliens, fas 2&quot; (engelska: FAR - Food security through climate Adapatation and Resilience, phase 2), med en totalt budget p&#xE5; 40 miljoner kronor, och en aktivitetsperiod p&#xE5; tv&#xE5; &#xE5;r (2021-2022). Programmet ineb&#xE4;r en andra fas av det p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende FAR-programmet (FAR I), d&#xE4;r vissa av de genomf&#xF6;rande organisationerna har uppvisat mycket goda resultat men d&#xE4;r problem har funnits med Sidas avtalspart (Swisscontact) och en av de tidigare genomf&#xF6;rande organisationerna. Ambassaden har d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r valt att avsluta p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende avtal med Swisscontact och bereda st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r en forts&#xE4;ttning genom organisationen IFDC. 

Det nya avtalsuppl&#xE4;gget antas ge ett mer effektivt genomf&#xF6;rande, b&#xE5;de utifr&#xE5;n ambassadens styrning och i implementeringen. Den andra fasen bygger p&#xE5; redan etablerade arbetss&#xE4;tt och ber&#xE4;knas kunna leverera resultat fr&#xE5;n b&#xF6;rjan av aktivitetsperioden. 

Genomf&#xF6;rande
Programmet genomf&#xF6;rs av fyra organisationer, vilka alla har varit genomf&#xF6;rare under FAR I och kunnat uppvisa mycket goda resultat. Dessa &#xE4;r: International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), United Purpose (UP), African Fertilizer and Agribusiness Partnership (AFAP), Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o Kwaedza Simukai Manica (AKSM). Respektive organisation har unika spetskompetenser vilka sammanv&#xE4;gt bed&#xF6;ms bidra till att uppfylla programmets &#xF6;verv&#xE4;gande m&#xE5;l om &#xF6;kad tillg&#xE5;ng till mat.  IFDC &#xE4;r Sidas avtalspart och &#xE4;r fullt ansvarigt f&#xF6;r uppf&#xF6;ljning och ledning av de implementerade organisationerna.  

Programmet kommer att samverka med offentliga och privata akt&#xF6;rer s&#xE5;som Mo&#xE7;ambiques nationella jordbruksforskningsinstitut IIAM (Instituto de Investiga&#xE7;&#xE3;o Agr&#xE1;ria de Mo&#xE7;ambique) samt f&#xF6;rankras lokalt hos relevanta provinsiella- och distriktsmyndigheter.  FAR II f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra med marknadsorienterade l&#xF6;sningar som har f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar att bli h&#xE5;llbara bortom Sidas finansiering.

M&#xE5;lgrupp och m&#xE5;l
Syftet med insatsen &#xE4;r att &#xF6;ka motst&#xE5;ndskraften bland den gruppen sm&#xE5;brukare som har potential att kunna utveckla sitt lantbruk, men vars f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjningsm&#xF6;jligheter &#xE4;r s&#xE5;rbara och saknar motst&#xE5;ndskraft mot negativa chocker. Forskning visar att det viktigaste skyddsn&#xE4;tet f&#xF6;r de allra fattigaste hush&#xE5;llen &#xE4;r ett motst&#xE5;ndskraftigt lokalsamh&#xE4;lle d&#xE5; dessa hush&#xE5;ll ofta &#xE4;r beroende av samh&#xE4;llsgemenskapen f&#xF6;r sin f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning. Att bist&#xE5; de grupperna som har kapacitet till sj&#xE4;lvhj&#xE4;lp kan d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas att &#xE4;ven ha en positiv inverkan p&#xE5; de mest utsatta.

Programmet f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas n&#xE5; ut till 15 500 sm&#xE5;brukare i provinserna Manica och Sofala. Minst 50% av m&#xE5;lgruppen ska vara kvinnor. 

Insatsen f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till f&#xF6;ljande m&#xE5;l &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;l:
&#x2022;	H&#xE5;llbar livsmedelsf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning med s&#xE4;rskilt fokus p&#xE5; ett motst&#xE5;ndskraftigt lantbruk.

Mer specifikt f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas insatsen bidra till:
&#x2022;	Diversifierade inkomstk&#xE4;llor (riskspridning/minskad exponering) och &#xF6;kade inkomster, sparande och/eller andra former av skyddsn&#xE4;t. 
&#x2022;	&#xD6;kad tillg&#xE5;ng till n&#xE4;ringsriktig mat genom ett mer produktivt och diversifierat lantbruk.
&#x2022;	&#xD6;kad kunskap om klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad anpassningsf&#xF6;rm&#xE5;ga bland sm&#xE5;skaliga lantbrukare, samt st&#xE4;rkt kapacitet att anamma nya metoder och motst&#xE5;ndskraftiga gr&#xF6;dor. 
&#x2022;	&#xD6;kat tillg&#xE5;ng till marknader f&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;lja odlade varor samt tillg&#xE5;ng till f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrat uts&#xE4;de och g&#xF6;dsel.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context
Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world and one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa to climate change. The majority of Mozambique&apos;s population lives in rural areas and depend on small-scale subsistence farming to support themselves. Climate change therefore poses a major threat to human food security. In 2016 and 2017, Mozambique was exposed to both drought and floods, and in 2019, the country was hit by two extreme weather events that destroyed both crops and infrastructure. Small-scale farmers generally have a very low capacity to protect themselves against the effects of climate change, which are expected to increase in strength and frequency in Mozambique. 

To address the challenges posed by climate adaptation and modernization, the programme &quot;FAR II: Food Security through climate Adaptation and Resilience, phase 2&quot;, with a budget of 40 million SEK, and an activity period of two years (2021-2022) is proposed. 

The program will address food security from a broad perspective. The objective is to increase resilience among the group of small farmers who have the potential to develop their agriculture, but whose livelihood opportunities are vulnerable and lack resilience to negative shocks. Furthermore, experience from other research shows that the most important safety net for the poorest households is a resilient local community, as these households often depend on the community for their livelihood. Assisting the groups that have the capacity for self-help can therefore be expected to have a positive impact on the most vulnerable. 

The program is expected to reach 15,500 smallholder farmers in the provinces of Manica and Sofala. At least 50% of the target group must be women. 

The following goals and results are intended for the planned effort to contribute to: 

&#x2022; Sustainable food supply with special focus on resilient agriculture. The framework of the results of the program is intended to include the following: 
&#x2022; Diversified sources of income (risk diversification / reduced exposure) and increased access to monetary income, savings and / or other forms of safety nets Increased access to food and nutrition through more productive agriculture 
&#x2022; Increased knowledge of climate change and improved adaptability among small-scale farmers, as well as strengthened capacity to adopt new methods and resistant crops 
&#x2022; Increased access to markets for selling production and access to improved seeds and fertilizers</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The four IOs of the consortium&#xA0;will support scaling the adoption of new climate-adapted technologies and practices for sustainable diversification and intensification of cereal, legume and vegetable crop production. In doing so, the interventions aims to improve household nutrition through increased food availability and dietary diversity from diversified farming systems that can grow more demand-preferred crops and nutritious foods, which can then be sold to market or consumed by households. With this intervention, it is expected that 15,500 producers will be assisted in CSA, GAP and ISFM technologies universally recognized as environmentally friendly. In order to implement the intervention, the&#xA0;IOs have complementary goals, operate at different levels in value chains, and maintain strong relationships with farmers and private sector actors, leading to the facilitation of synergies and increased impact in the field.
To ensure an impactful implementation of the programme the MO and the IOs intend to set up a team of Monitoring and Evaluation Officers (one from each organisation) to monitor and identify trends, successes, and bottlenecks in order to make course-corrections and share learnings between the IOs during the implementation of FAR II.The MO will measure progress in the following three result areas:
&#xA0;
Results Area 1: Scaling Improved Smallholder Productivity 
To improve access to and use of improved inputs, seeds, and fertilizers (such as high-yielding varieties and appropriate fertilizer blends), The programme will provide capacity building support to strengthen existing VLSAs and Farmers Organizations. This will facilitate access to capital for the purchase of agricultural inputs that can guarantee access to markets for demand-preferred crops and produce. This will be achieved through promoting climate-adapted crops/varieties and by facilitating the purchase and installation of renewable energy mini agro-processing equipment to create value-added and enable and local production/consumption.
&#xA0;
Results Area 2: Scaling Agro-Dealer Networks for Input/Output Market Development
&#xA0;
To achieve the result targets of &quot;Result Area 1&quot;, the program need to scale up agro-dealer distribution networks to enable the distribution and use of productivity-enhancing inputs and production technologies for farmers. To accomplish this, the programme will support village-based agents (VBAs) and rural based agro-dealer start-ups linked to agro-dealer networks.&#xA0;To capacitate actors that link farmers to market, FAR II intend to provide enterprise management capacity building on working capital, stock control, costing and pricing, financial literacy and record keeping, and ICT financial services for agribusiness.&#xA0;Scaling agro-dealers and agents through the &#x201C;hub&#x201D; approach is expected to result in more efficient distribution networks that can reach smallholder farmers with more cost-efficient and cost-effective products and services. VBAs and agro-dealers will also receive training on output marketing and linked to traders.
&#xA0;
Results Area 3: Scaling Proven Technologies
In order to&#xA0;provide the technical support needed to scale CSA / GAP technologies for sustainable intensification of cereal, legume and vegetable production, the FAR II Consortium will utalize their partnerships scale dissemination of &#x201C;technology packages&#x201D; to farmer organizations or clusters through networked partnerships with public and private sector actors. This will be done through e.g. providing&#xA0;technical support to farmers and agro-dealers on how to set up farm demonstrations and testing of improved inputs. The IOs will also promte the expanision of ICT technolgie, such as M-phone for mobile-base e-payments that to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and innovative and sustainable applications for ICT4Ag to benefit Mozambican farmers through better access to information (e.g. on prices).
&#xA0;
KPIs for follow-up (subject to measurement of gender disaggregated results):
1) Number of farmers who adopted CSA / GAP promoted by the program
2) Average increase in crop yield in kilograms per hectare and annual season
3) Number of agro-dealers and VBAs trained and established
4) Volume of inputs (improved seeds, fertilizer, and agrochemical products, etc.) sold through agro-dealer networks
5) Value of inputs (improved seeds, fertilizer, and agrochemical products, etc.) sold through agro-dealer networks
6) Number of farmers accessing inputs and agronomic extension services through agro-dealer networks
7) Volume of agricultural products (grains and pulses) sold through agro-dealer networks
8) Value of agricultural products (grains and pulses) sold through agro-dealer networks
9) Number of CSA technologies adopted by farmers
10) Number agribusinesses, agro-dealers and entrepreneurs who improve operational capacities as a result of skills training
11) Number agribusinesses, agro-dealers and entrepreneurs who improve operational capacities as a result of skills training</narrative>

Sida har st&#xF6;tt AERC med k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d och projektst&#xF6;d sedan b&#xF6;rjan av 1990-talet. AERC har sedan start 1988 genomf&#xF6;rt nationalekonomiska forskningsprojekt, utbildning av nationalekonomer i samarbete med universitet och kommunicerat forskningsresultat och policyrekommendationer till myndigheter och banker. AERCs &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;l har sedan start varit, och &#xE4;r fortfarande, att st&#xE4;rka och utveckla institutioners och individers kapacitet att genomf&#xF6;ra, kommunicera och implementera nationalekonomisk forskning och forskningsresultat.    

AERCs huvudkontor ligger i Nairobi d&#xE4;r en personalgrupp p&#xE5; 35 personer arbetar. Konsortiet mottar k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n en rad givare, bland annat NORAD, DFID, USAID, V&#xE4;rldsbanken, DANIDA, AfDB, African Central Banks Group och andra afrikanska samarbetspartner till exempel Sydafrika och Kenya. Den &#xE5;rliga budgeten var 18 miljoner US$ 2014. Den st&#xF6;rsta utgiftsposten &#xE4;r mastersutbildningen i nationalekonomi och till&#xE4;mpad nationalekonomi i jordbruksekonomi som tillsammans utgjorde 34% av budgeten 2014. Det tematiska forskningsprogrammet utgjorde 22% och forskarutbildningen utgjorde 19% av budgeten samma &#xE5;r. I den senaste revisionsrapporten och i den senaste externa utv&#xE4;rderingen lyfts det minskade intresset f&#xF6;r k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d och ett &#xF6;kat intresse f&#xF6;r projektst&#xF6;d hos givarna fram som en utmaning f&#xF6;r AERC.
    
AERC &#xE4;r ett medlemskonsortium registrerad i Delaware, USA, som en icke vinstdrivande och icke-statlig organisation. Ett &quot;Host Agreement&quot; daterat 1999-09-11 mellan Kenyanska staten och AERC reglerar AERCs r&#xE4;ttighter och skyldigheter att verka som organisation i Kenya. AERC har byggt upp ett n&#xE4;tverk av 38 universitet f&#xF6;r att organisera forskarutbildning och mastersutbildning i nationalekonomi. I AERCs mastersprogram &#xE4;r universiteten indelade i kategorier. Fr&#xE5;n de svagaste nationalekonomiska institutionerna (A-universitet) skickas studenter till de universitet som bed&#xF6;mts ha fullgod utbildningskapacitet inom baskurserna (B-universitet). Valbara kurser f&#xF6;r specialisering ges vid Joint Facility for Electives vid Kenya School of Monetary Studies i Nairobi. Fyra universitet &#xE4;r s&#xE5; kallade C-universitet och ger b&#xE5;de baskurser och valbara kurser. Alla universitet som ing&#xE5;r i forskarutbildningsprogrammet &#xE4;r ackrediterade och kan utf&#xE4;rda doktorsexamen. Universiteten i forskarutbildningsprogrammet &#xE4;r indelade i tv&#xE5; kategorier, de som tar emot forskarstudenter f&#xF6;r att erbjuda kurser och de som skickar forskarstudenter. AERC vidaref&#xF6;rmedlar ca. 25%-30% av den &#xE5;rliga budgeten iform av institutionella bidrag till universiteten och som stipendier till studenter och forskare.  

Individuell kapacitetsutveckling sker s&#xE5;ledes inom utbildning av ekonomer p&#xE5; mastersniv&#xE5; och forskarutbildning. D&#xE4;rut&#xF6;ver ges forskare och l&#xE4;rare m&#xF6;jligheter att delta i tekniska workshops, vetenskapliga konferenser, i utbytesprogram etc. M&#xE5;nga forskare och l&#xE4;rare utf&#xF6;r sitt dagliga arbete i mer eller mindre vetenskaplig isolering och en m&#xF6;jlighet att presentera sin forskning och delta i kritiska diskussioner &#xE4;r mycket viktigt f&#xF6;r att kvalitetss&#xE4;kra forskning och s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla att undervisningen vid universiteten vilar p&#xE5; vetenskaplig grund. F&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka den institutionella kapaciteten vid framf&#xF6;r allt de nationalekonomiska institutionerna vid universiteten arrangerar AERC gemensamma kurser, &#xF6;versyn &#xF6;ver kurslitteratur och kursuppl&#xE4;gg, gemensam examination etc. Myndigheter och banker f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas ocks&#xE5; st&#xE4;rkas av tillg&#xE5;ng till utbildade ekonomer med master- eller doktorsexamen.   

&#xD6;ver &#xE5;ren har 400 forskarstudenter disputerat och mer &#xE4;n 3000 studenter tagit masterexamen i nationalekonomi. AERC har &#xE4;ven arrangerat en rad nationella och internationella policyseminarier. I de st&#xF6;rre forskningsprojekten som samlar internationellt ansedda utvecklingsekonomer och nationalekonomer, b&#xE5;de fr&#xE5;n kontinenten och utanf&#xF6;r, har viktiga forskningsresultat genererats som till&#xE4;mpats i policy.  

I den strategiska planen f&#xF6;r 2015-2020 &#xE4;r m&#xE5;let att bredda AERCs aktiviteter till underrepresenterade l&#xE4;nder och grupper. Det handlar framf&#xF6;rallt om att &#xF6;ka andelen forskare och studenter fr&#xE5;n postkonflikt- och sk&#xF6;ra stater, &#xF6;ka andelen kvinnor p&#xE5; alla niv&#xE5;er samt &#xF6;ka representationen av fransk- och portugisisktalande studenter och forskare.
    
J&#xE4;mf&#xF6;rt med de tidigare avtalen, Bridging support to AERC 2014-2015 (18 miljoner kronor) och Agreement on Research Cooperation Between Sida and AERC on support of research activities during 2010-2013 (48 miljoner kronor), Agreement on Research Cooperation 2006-2009 (54 miljoner kronor) inneb&#xE4;r det nya avtalet en &#xF6;kning av bidragsbeloppet. Sida blir i och med avtalet en av de st&#xF6;rre givarna till AERC. Sida motiverar detta med att det kr&#xE4;vs ett &#xF6;kat k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d till AERC f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra den planerade breddningen av programmet och inkludera underrepresenterade grupper och l&#xE4;nder, framf&#xF6;r allt nya samarbetspartners i sk&#xF6;ra stater. Det &#xF6;kade st&#xF6;det motiveras &#xE4;ven av ett minskat intresse f&#xF6;r k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n andra givare, vilket till viss del h&#xE4;nger samman med intr&#xE4;det av nya givare. Detta &#xE4;r en komplex utveckling d&#xE5; ett minskat intresse f&#xF6;r k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d kan leda till minskat &#xE4;garskap f&#xF6;r AERC d&#xE5; givare intresserar sig f&#xF6;r vissa aktiviteter och d&#xE4;rmed riktar verksamheten. Men flera av de nya givarna &#xE4;r afrikanska stater vilket &#xE4;r positivt d&#xE5; det &#xF6;kar det afrikanska &#xE4;garskapet. I denna positiva process som inletts med att attrahera nya afrikanska givare och inkludera nya samarbetsuniversitet och underrepresenterade grupper &#xE4;r det Sidas bed&#xF6;mning att ett &#xF6;kat st&#xF6;d p&#xE5; sikt kan och b&#xF6;r leda till ett starkare afrikanskt &#xE4;garskap.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This information has been taken from conclusion on performance September 2020.&#xA0; The year 2019/20 marks the fifth and final year of implementation of the 2015-2020 strategic plan. The focus in the final year has been to ensure that all targets in the strategy were achieved.&#xA0; The approved PWB 2019/2020 focused on activities that provided outcomes that include:&#xA0; * Policy outreach through policy briefs and thesis dissemination.&#xA0; * Regional policy forums to engage and inform policy makers.&#xA0; * Resource mobilization across funders to close the financing gap in 2019/2020.&#xA0; * Continuing to enlarge the African stakeholdership through the AERC African Central Banks&apos; Forum.&#xA0; * Private sector mutually beneficial engagement.&#xA0; * Developing the strategic directions for 2020-2025 to provide a seamless transition from the current planning cycle to the next; and,&#xA0; * Visibility of AERC through enhanced website management&#xA0;and roll-out of the communication strategy.&#xA0; &#xA0; Challenges remaining:&#xA0; The final year of the strategy had less resources, therefore, 2019/20 started with a financing gap. Even though this was covered, the Training program remains the one with reduced activity level and thus inflating the management cost ratios.&#xA0; The changing environment where most funders&#xA0;prefer short-term, earmarked funding is a recurring problem and challenge that will be even more significant in the future.&#xA0;&#xA0; Objective 1: Enhanced capacity building for economic policy research and graduate training in sub-Saharan Africa&#xA0; Two plenary sessions were held during the year. The first one, in June, was on the theme: &quot;Growing with Debt in African Economies: Options, Challenges and Pitfalls&quot;. The second plenary session was on the theme: &quot;Business Environment, Competitiveness and Economic Growth in Africa&quot;. The session was held in December in Nairobi in honour of Prof. Shantayanan&#xA0;Devarajan, following his retirement from the World Bank.&#xA0; At the two plenary sessions&#xA0;AERC&#xA0;as usually arranged policy roundtables&#xA0;and at both occasions the policy roundtables&#xA0;were &quot;Ladies Policy Roundtable&quot; with prominent female doctors and professors.&#xA0;&#xA0; The biannual research workshops took place at the same time as the plenary sessions. In total 48 doctoral students presented their work at the two workshops.&#xA0; The number of students graduates from CMAP&#xA0;and CMAAE&#xA0;are above the targets. The number of graduates from CPP&#xA0;is below the target, which can be explained by resource constraints to the training programmes.&#xA0;&#xA0; A number of activities took place within the Bridge programme. One of most important to mention is that 10 proposals were awarded&#xA0;development grants of US$3000 each for further development and analysis. So far, 8 (7 men and 1 female) out of 26 PhD bridge&#xA0;programme alumni have been awarded CPP scholarships. All six outcome indicators for the outcome &quot;Enhanced participation of under-represented countries, groups and institutions, including post-conflict and fragile states in economic policy&quot;, show results above the set targets. Viewed in this light the conclusion is that the bridge-programme has been very successful.&#xA0; &#xA0; To improve and assure the quality at the training programmes examination of the courses is under the responsibility of the Academic Advisory Board, which held its meeting in May 2019, for approval of examination results.&#xA0; To support departments at the universities AERC&#xA0;awarded annual operating and institutional grants to 11 CMAP&#xA0;collaborating universities, 8 CPP&#xA0;degree-awarding universities and 8 CMAAE&#xA0;accredited universities.&#xA0; The achieved results (targets in brackets)&#xA0;for graduation of CMAP-universities was 4 (7) category-C, 7 (9) category-B and 15 (11) category-A. It means that the target was only met when it comes to accepting new universities into the AERC-network. One university was upgraded to an accredited&#xA0;university in the CMAAE programme, which&#xA0;was also the target.&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0; Objective 2: Build and strengthen&#xA0;national, regional and global linkages to generate high quality economic policy research and graduate training.&#xA0; During the reporting year AERC&#xA0;has successfully progressed with five collaborative research projects: * Healthcare&#xA0;Financing in Africa, is in the final stage and a final review workshop took place in October 2019 in Accra, Ghana. * Rethinking Trade and Regional Integration, is in the final stage and a final review workshop was held in October 2019, in Lusaka, Zambia. Two journals, The World Economy and Journal of African Trade, were identified for possible publication of articles. * Impact of Agricultural and Food Policies on Nutrition Outcomes in Africa - a mid-review and final review workshops were held in April 2019 and October 2019 and 15 research teams presented their work-in-progress and final reports.&#xA0; * Rethinking Relationships Between Growth, Poverty, Inequality and Redistribution in Africa, an inception workshop was held back to back with the June 2019 Biannual research workshop. Work-in-progress reports were discussed and commented on by Prof. Erik Thorbecke&#xA0;at a mid-review workshop. Of the 13 papers, 5 have been selected for presentation at the World Congress of the International Economic Association, IEA, in July 2020 in Indonesia.&#xA0; * Climate Change and Economic Development in Africa, 11 framework papers were commissioned at an inception workshop held back-to-back with the December 2019 Biannual research&#xA0;workshop. Prof. John Asafu-Adjaye&#xA0;was appointed as project coordinator and Prof. Th&#xE9;ophile&#xA0;T. Azomahou&#xA0;was appointed as Resource Person.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; During the reporting year AERC&#xA0;became a member of T20 Think Tanks - a selected group of think tanks associated with the G20 platform. The T20 Think Tanks is a technical arm of G20 and work with research for policy making. AERC contributed to two policy briefs: &quot;Industrial development and ICT in Africa&quot; and Fiscal and Debt Sustainability in Africa&quot;.&#xA0; Objective 3: Engage the private sector in mutually beneficial research and training activities to enhance Innovation and to deepen and broaden AERC cpapcity building Two results areas were identified under this objective. The first one was to engage the private sector in AERC Plenary Conferences. At the June 2019 Biannual workshop six new research papers, relevant to the private sector, were presented. The number of actors from private sectors who have participated in AERC&#xA0;activities are above the set target while the set target for number of actors participating in dissemination activities were below the set target.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Objective 4: Enhance AERC Visibility, Outreach as well as Policy Engagement&#xA0;to maximize the uptake of AERC Products in Policy AERC has achieved some interesting results under objective 4, during the fiscal year. A Communication Agency of Record was procured to help AERC modernise it&apos;s communication strategy and strategic around its visibility of its brand. Several activities in relation to that has taken place and will continue in the new strategic plan period.&#xA0; Publications from AERC has been made available from Columbia University, which has agreed to include publications and policy briefs within their library portal, which reaches 450 universities and institutions worldwide. AERC publications link with Research Papers in Economics (REPEC) has been restored after the url migration from Access Kenya to BlueHost.&#xA0; Specific publications that can be worth mentioning from the year are: A report book on Fragility of Growth in African Economies was published and distributed. A book-length volume on Fragility of Growth in African Economies was published in in February 2020.&#xA0; One Regional Policy Forum for the Central Africa Region was held in Kigali, Rwanda in December 2019. The title of the Policy Forum was&#xA0;&quot;Gender and Resource Management for Economic Development&quot;. The aim with the Regional Policy Forums&#xA0;is to address the needs of the middle-level policy makers who have previously not been reached by the Senior Policy Seminars, bridging the gap between Senior Policy Seminars and national policy workshops.&#xA0; Objective 5: Maximise mutual benefits through diversified resources base and stakeholder-ship for sustainability AERC&#xA0;has been implementing a resource mobilization strategy with positive outcomes. For example the efforts to intensify existing partnerships resulted in six signed grant&#xA0;agreements with DFID, African Union Development Agency, ZEF&#xA0;(a&#xA0; German&#xA0;research institute), IDRC, Gates Foundation, GIZ.&#xA0; One of the key activities during the reporting year is the drafting and adoption of the strategic plan for 2020-2025. A mid-term evaluation report was conducted by Prof. Frances Stewart of oxford University and Prof. Ernest Aryeetey&#xA0;of the African Research Universities Alliance, Ghana.&#xA0; Based on lessons learnt,&#xA0;recommendations, and numerous consultations with the Board and other stakeholders, the strategic plan 2020-2025 has adopted a new approach focusing on outcomes and impact measurements.&#xA0; Improved HR capacity has also been achieved due to successful recruitment of a new Director of Research and a new Chief Finance Officer.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
UN Women, Internationella Juristkommissionen (ICJ) och FN:s h&#xF6;gkommissaries kontor f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter (OHCHR) har ans&#xF6;kt om SEK 79 500 000 i st&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n Sida f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra ett gemensamt regionalt projekt i Asien och Oceanien under ben&#xE4;mningen:  &#x201D;Enhancing Access to Justice for Women in Asia and the Pacific: Bridging the gap between formal and informal system through womens empowerment&#x201D; (fritt &#xF6;versatt: F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra tillg&#xE5;ng till r&#xE4;ttvisa f&#xF6;r kvinnor i Asien och Oceanien: &#xD6;verbrygga gapet mellan formella och informella r&#xE4;ttssystem genom att st&#xE4;rka kvinnors st&#xE4;llning&#x201D;) under  perioden 2018-2022.

Insatsen syftar till att st&#xE4;rka kvinnors tillg&#xE5;ng till r&#xE4;ttvisa och &#xF6;verkomma hinder i form av diskriminerande normer och lagar, kunskapsbrist och sociala m&#xF6;nster hos bl.a. r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE5;rdande myndigheter, institutioner och domstolar. Projektet syftar till att st&#xE4;rka kvinnors st&#xE4;llning och kapacitet i kontakterna med r&#xE4;ttv&#xE5;rdande institutioner. Projektet kommer att fokusera p&#xE5; Indonesien, Filippinerna, Nepal, Sri Lanka, &#xD6;sttimor och l&#xE4;nder i Oceanien.

Insatsen har tre huvudsakliga komponenter:

1.	Att verka f&#xF6;r att nationell lagstiftning och domstolsutslag &#xF6;verensst&#xE4;mmer med de internationella normer som definieras i bl. a FN:s kvinnokonvention (CEDAW). Projektet kommer sammanst&#xE4;lla en j&#xE4;mf&#xF6;relse av nationella lagars med internationella normer och standarder och identifiera gap som beh&#xF6;ver &#xE5;tg&#xE4;rdas.

2.	Att bidra till att st&#xE4;rka kunskapen och kapaciteten inom r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE5;rdande institutioner om j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;llhet och kvinnors r&#xE4;ttigheter och bidra till att avskaffandet av k&#xF6;nsbaserad diskriminering och sociala stereotyper som drabbar kvinnor negativt inom s&#xE5;v&#xE4;l formell som informell r&#xE4;ttssektor.

3.	Att st&#xE4;rka kvinnliga gr&#xE4;srotsorganisationer s&#xE5; att de blir b&#xE4;ttre rustade f&#xF6;r att dokumentera, &#xF6;vervaka, samordna samverkan mellan formella och informella r&#xE4;ttssystem i trygga former.
Projektet ska genomf&#xF6;ras av tre delatagande organisationerna i n&#xE4;ra samarbete med lokala, nationella och regionala akt&#xF6;rer (domare, &#xE5;klagare, polis, advokater, parlamentariker, lokala myndigheter, kvinnoorganisationer samt nationella MR-kommissioner).

F&#xF6;rdelningen av den totala budgeten per organisation: UN Women: 47 %, ICJ: 46.8% OHCHR: 6.3 %. 
UN Women tar ut en administrativ kostnad p&#xE5; 8 % av projekts totala budget. H&#xE4;lften av pengarna som g&#xE5;r till UN Women kommer att vidaref&#xF6;rmedlas som st&#xF6;d till civilsamh&#xE4;llesorganisationer under hela 5-&#xE5;rsperioden.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During this reporting period (the period from January 2019 to December 2019), the project &#x2018;&#x201C;Enhancing Access to Justice for Women in Asia and the Pacific; Bridging the gap between formal and informal systems through women&#x2019;s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific&#x201D; carried out activities as planned. It was able to reach different target groups in Asia and the Pacific region with a focus on Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Pacific. At the community-level, 30 grass-roots organizations strengthened their knowledge on women&#x2019;s access to justice, and over 1,600 community members benefitted from the 40 community awareness sessions on gender discriminatory norms. At the national level, the programme reached over 500 women lawyers to increase their knowledge and skills. To advance women&#x2019;s rights at the regional level, the programme conducted a Regional Judicial Dialogue on the Elimination on Discrimination against Women and hosted a consultation in support of the Special Rapporteur&#x2019;s work on the right to freedom of religion or belief. Regarding the intervention on the environment perspective, there was the establishment of the Pacific Human Rights Defenders Network to strengthen the voices of women to tackle climate change. In addition, the programme partners used their internationally recognized mandates to shed light on women&#x2019;s rights issues in Asia, utilizing the United Nations Human Rights Council sessions. In sum, through the partnership between UN Women, ICJ, and OHCHR, the programme was able to reach different target groups by implementing bottom-up activities such as community dialogues on women&#x2019;s rights as well as regional dialogues with judges and members of United Nations Special Procedures. &#xA0; Examples of results  Output 1. Adoption of domestic laws and court decisions in the target countries consistent with international human rights law and standards, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, is promoted. In Indonesia, ICJ OHCHR and UN Women worked with non-governmental organizations, government bodies, and United Nations agencies on the proposed amendment of the draft Criminal Code that contains explicit discriminatory sections against women. Finally the Indonesian legislature did not pass the Penal Code amendments in 2019, which provides the programme with the opportunity to continue government dialogues, support to human rights groups, and to mobilize communities to advocate for CEDAW-compliant legislative change. In Nepal, the Nepal Bar Association conducted its 28th National Conference of Women Lawyers, which was attended by over 500 female legal professionals and resulted in the adoption of the 21-Point Dharan Declaration which focused on addressing existing barriers to the effective implementation and formulation of gender-responsive laws and policies. In the Philippines, ICJ has been working closely with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to train lawyers to provide legal services to women. Consequently, IBP established a Gender and Development (GAD) Committee, which has the mandate of ensuring gender equality in the legal profession and eliminating gender discriminatory practices among lawyers. The Supreme Court of the Philippines approved the request of IBP to instate GAD as one of the standing and permanent committees of the Bar Association. &#xA0; Output 2: Gender discriminatory attitudes and behaviours towards women by formal and informal justice providers are acknowledged and addressed by formal and informal justice providers in the target countries.  In collaboration with the Malaysian Judicial Academy and the Federal Court of Malaysia, ICJ co-organized a Regional Judicial Dialogue on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Feedback from participants indicated that the content and discussions of the judicial dialogue significantly increased their knowledge of relevant international human rights law and standards related to the elimination of discrimination against women, including CEDAW and the Bangkok General Guidance. The majority of the participants stated they will use the knowledge, information, and tools presented at the judicial dialogue in their work as judges at the domestic level. The regional consultation with the Special Rapporteur&#x2019;s work on the right to freedom of religion or belief in the context of non-discrimination as the dialogue platform for human rights defenders, formal justice providers from across Asia, including Bangladesh, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines, and Thailand. The objectives of the consultation were to provide a forum for participants, particularly WHRDs and HRDs for sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC), and faith-based actors, to share their perspectives on laws, practices, and anti-rights strategies that discriminate against individuals in Asia based on SOGIESC. Based on this dialogue, the report to the United Nations Human Rights Council was developed on &#x201C;Countering the false dichotomy between the right to freedom of religion or belief and the right to non-discrimination: Challenges on the ground and the need for human rights literacy&#x201D;. &#xA0; Output 3. Grass-roots women&#x2019;s organizations and community-based women&#x2019;s organizations are empowered and well-positioned to document, monitor, liaise, and facilitate interactions with formal and informal justice providers, and their resilience is enhanced to build a just and sustainable future.  In Nepal, the programme chose to work with 10 municipalities on a community-based justice approach. UN Women interventions, carried out by its national and local CSO partners, enhanced the capacity of community-based justice mechanisms (formal and informal) and increased women&#x2019;s confidence and legal literacy. Women&#x2019;s grass-roots organizations and WHRDs were supported and communities were involved for protection and social change. In Timor-Leste, UN Women in partnership with Timor-Leste&apos;s National Directorate for Community Conflict Prevention (DNPCC) developed the gender-responsive mediation guidelines as well as a gender-responsive case management system. OHCHR co-organized a workshop for indigenous youth HRDs in Bangkok. A safe space to discuss human rights, women&#x2019;s rights, and climate justice issues was provided to indigenous youth HRDs. Considering the severe impact of climate change on small Pacific Islands States, OHCHR Pacific Office supports WHRDs, to increase their capacity to monitor the implementation of human rights, liaise with key stakeholders, follow up on human rights treaty body recommendations, and use human rights mechanisms. It strengthens women&#x2019;s understanding of how to engage with government, national human rights institutions, and justice representatives on human rights issues, including in the context of climate change and business. To this end, OHCHR supported the creation of the Pacific Human Rights Defenders Network, which was launched in July 2019. &#xA0; Though the key activities were proactively implemented through local, national, and regional approach, it is apparent that more results oriented, analytical and qualitative reporting is still needed. During this reporting year, some activities have just been started up. This explains the report is activity-based rather than result-oriented. In the upcoming reporting, the results/outcomes of these initiatives will be followed up and reported. &#xA0; Covid19 consequences to programming In the first six months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all countries given the health, economic and social challenges. In addition, COVID-19 has deepened social injustice and highlighted the dire consequences of poor leadership and a weak rule of law. For WA2J, programme activities that were scheduled for 2020 were revisited and amended to fit the context. Women grassroots organizations received financial and technical support to continue their work, provide protection and support to women in the communities. The programme partners conducted a number of webinars with legal service providers, conducted research on the impact of COVID on women&#x2019;s access to justice and partnered with local NGOs to conduct virtual scoping missions. Activities in some countries with lower COVID impact, e.g. Timor-Leste and Fiji, were continued. Funds that were not utilized for travel were partially used to subscribe to online platforms and to upscale technical know-how on how to engage with our stakeholders online.</narrative>

UN Women, Internationella Juristkommissionen (ICJ) och FN:s h&#xF6;gkommissaries kontor f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter (OHCHR) har ans&#xF6;kt om SEK 79 500 000 i st&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n Sida f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra ett gemensamt regionalt projekt i Asien och Oceanien under ben&#xE4;mningen:  &#x201D;Enhancing Access to Justice for Women in Asia and the Pacific: Bridging the gap between formal and informal system through womens empowerment&#x201D; (fritt &#xF6;versatt: F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra tillg&#xE5;ng till r&#xE4;ttvisa f&#xF6;r kvinnor i Asien och Oceanien: &#xD6;verbrygga gapet mellan formella och informella r&#xE4;ttssystem genom att st&#xE4;rka kvinnors st&#xE4;llning&#x201D;) under  perioden 2018-2022.

Insatsen syftar till att st&#xE4;rka kvinnors tillg&#xE5;ng till r&#xE4;ttvisa och &#xF6;verkomma hinder i form av diskriminerande normer och lagar, kunskapsbrist och sociala m&#xF6;nster hos bl.a. r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE5;rdande myndigheter, institutioner och domstolar. Projektet syftar till att st&#xE4;rka kvinnors st&#xE4;llning och kapacitet i kontakterna med r&#xE4;ttv&#xE5;rdande institutioner. Projektet kommer att fokusera p&#xE5; Indonesien, Filippinerna, Nepal, Sri Lanka, &#xD6;sttimor och l&#xE4;nder i Oceanien.

Insatsen har tre huvudsakliga komponenter:

1.	Att verka f&#xF6;r att nationell lagstiftning och domstolsutslag &#xF6;verensst&#xE4;mmer med de internationella normer som definieras i bl. a FN:s kvinnokonvention (CEDAW). Projektet kommer sammanst&#xE4;lla en j&#xE4;mf&#xF6;relse av nationella lagars med internationella normer och standarder och identifiera gap som beh&#xF6;ver &#xE5;tg&#xE4;rdas.

2.	Att bidra till att st&#xE4;rka kunskapen och kapaciteten inom r&#xE4;ttsv&#xE5;rdande institutioner om j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;llhet och kvinnors r&#xE4;ttigheter och bidra till att avskaffandet av k&#xF6;nsbaserad diskriminering och sociala stereotyper som drabbar kvinnor negativt inom s&#xE5;v&#xE4;l formell som informell r&#xE4;ttssektor.

3.	Att st&#xE4;rka kvinnliga gr&#xE4;srotsorganisationer s&#xE5; att de blir b&#xE4;ttre rustade f&#xF6;r att dokumentera, &#xF6;vervaka, samordna samverkan mellan formella och informella r&#xE4;ttssystem i trygga former.
Projektet ska genomf&#xF6;ras av tre delatagande organisationerna i n&#xE4;ra samarbete med lokala, nationella och regionala akt&#xF6;rer (domare, &#xE5;klagare, polis, advokater, parlamentariker, lokala myndigheter, kvinnoorganisationer samt nationella MR-kommissioner).

F&#xF6;rdelningen av den totala budgeten per organisation: UN Women: 47 %, ICJ: 46.8% OHCHR: 6.3 %. 
UN Women tar ut en administrativ kostnad p&#xE5; 8 % av projekts totala budget. H&#xE4;lften av pengarna som g&#xE5;r till UN Women kommer att vidaref&#xF6;rmedlas som st&#xF6;d till civilsamh&#xE4;llesorganisationer under hela 5-&#xE5;rsperioden.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The&#xA0;CEFPF&#x2019;s performance measure against the target outcome at the completion of all projects in its portfolio. To date, the combined support of the CEFPF and Climate Change Fund Clean Energy Component (CCF-CE) have surpassed the (two) outcome level targets for CO2 emission reduction (27.1 million tons of CO2 emission reduction/year attained vs. target of 20.0 million of CO2 emission reduction/year) and energy savings (18.7 terra-watt hour-equivalent/year of energy savings attained vs. target of 18.0 TWh-eq/year). The installed renewable energy capacity reached 2,329.8 mega-watt (MW) which is 67% achievement rate of the 3,500 MW target. Meanwhile, the renewable energy generation reached 7.4 TWh/year which is 74% achievement rate of the 10 TWh/year target.&#xA0; In terms&#xA0;of outputs level indicators, 12 out of the 16 indicators are progressing well and have achieved at least 75% of the target.&#xA0;There are 4 output indicators that require significant work which include households provided with access to energy in participating developing member countries (DMCs) supported, households connected to modern fuels and/or efficient devices for heating, households connected to modern fuels and/or efficient devices for cooking, and carbon capture and storage&#xA0;demonstration projects.&#xA0; Gender aspects is related to the output - Benefits from access to energy delivered.&#xA0;To date, CEFPF has supported 36 projects with access to energy components that will benefit 392,887 households provided with energy access. This number falls short of the target 700,000 household, which illustrates the difficulty encountered by the CEFPF in attracting&#xA0;access to energy projects.&#xA0;The CEFPF will continue the multi-sector approach including sectors such as transport, agriculture, water and education sectors that are likely to integrate more clean renewable energy solutions into project design and development. In energy sector, the ADB is addressing the impact of CVOID-19 through projects. For example, the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease&#xA0;has raised concerns on the transmission of viruses through centralized air conditioning (CAC) systems.&#xA0;In many ADB&apos;s Developing Member Countries (DMCs), the risk of transmission in CAC systems is higher because of inadequate hygiene standards. Toward this, the CEFPF co-financed a Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance (KSTA) to support DMCs mitigate the risks of virus transmission and ensure safe working conditions in public buildings by deploying efficient, clean, and smart CAC&#xA0;systems.&#xA0;It is envisioned that pilot systems will demonstrate the effectively&#xA0;of the technology and be taken up by the DMCs to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 and other transmittable diseases.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
Det Europieska Skogsinstitutet (European Forest Institute, EFI) har ans&#xF6;kt om st&#xF6;d att genomf&#xF6;ra EU FLEGT Action Plan i Asien (FLEGT Asia II) genom EU FLEGT Facility som st&#xF6;djer genomf&#xF6;randet av det &#xF6;vergripande programmet EU FLEGT Action Plan som &#xE4;r aktivt i Latinamerika, Afrika och Asien. FLEGT st&#xE5;r f&#xF6;r Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade. FLEGT bek&#xE4;mpar illegalt skogsbruk och st&#xF6;djer f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad skogsf&#xF6;rvaltning. Det svenska bidraget st&#xF6;djer det &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;let med EU FLEGT Asia men kommer att fokusera p&#xE5; tv&#xE5; omr&#xE5;den.
1. Att st&#xE4;rka det regionala samarbetet inom FLEGT i Asien.
2. Definiera policies och mekanismer, inkl. pilotprojekt, f&#xF6;r st&#xF6;d till sm&#xE5;, mellan- och medelstora f&#xF6;retag (SME&#xB4;s) i att uppfylla de str&#xE4;ngare marknadskraven f&#xF6;r export av timmer och tr&#xE4;varor till EU-l&#xE4;nder som FLEGT med tillh&#xF6;rande regler inneb&#xE4;r.

Det totala budgeten f&#xF6;r FLEGT Asia &#xE4;r (2013-2019) &#xE4;r 11,9 miljoner Euro. &#xD6;ronm&#xE4;rkt finansiering till FLEGT Asia kommer fr&#xE5;n:  Europeiska Kommissionen (EC) 4,8 miljoner Euro, Holland 1 miljon Euro, Sverige 4 miljoner Euro. Underskott i finansieringen &#xE4;r f.n. 2,1 miljoner Euro. EFI uppger att Holland planerar att f&#xF6;rl&#xE4;nga och &#xF6;ka sitt st&#xF6;d och att Finland har uttryckt intresse. D&#xE4;rut&#xF6;ver f&#xE5;r FLEGT Asia del av icke &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta pengar fr&#xE5;n EU FLEGT Facility om Styrkommitt&#xE9;en s&#xE5; beslutar, vilket redan sker.

En portf&#xF6;ljanalys har genomf&#xF6;rts i enlighet med Sidas (EKOADM:s) tolkning av regleringsbrevets villkor om att undvika att teckna st&#xF6;rre och/eller l&#xE4;ngre avtal mot slutet av en strategiperiod eftersom det &#xE4;r EKOADM p&#xE5; Sida som ansvarar f&#xF6;r hur regleringsbrevet ska tolkas. Nuvarande strategi l&#xF6;per ut under 2015. M&#xE5;let att minst 50 respektive 75 procent av nuvarande &#xE5;rsvolym (200 MSEK) skall vara ointecknat ett respektive tv&#xE5; &#xE5;r efter det att strategin l&#xF6;per ut, uppfylls. Den f&#xF6;reslagna insatsen har sista utbetalnings&#xE5;r 2018 och avtalsslut under 2019, vilket &#xF6;verensst&#xE4;mmer med EKOADM:s tolkning av villkoret g&#xE4;llande hur l&#xE5;ngt in i framtiden en utbetalning kan genomf&#xF6;ras och avtal str&#xE4;cka sig efter strategiperiodens slut.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The European Forest Institute (EFI) has requested support to implement the EU FLEGT Action Plan in Asia (FLEGT Asia II) through EU FLEGT Facility. The EU FLEGT Action Plan, which is active in Latin America, Africa and Asia. FLEGT stands for Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade. FLEGT combat illegal forestry and supports improved forest management. The Swedish contribution supports the total EU FLEGT Facility Asia but will focus on two areas;

1. Strengthening regional cooperation on FLEGT in Asia.
2. Defining policies and support mechanisms, including pilots,  for SMEs to comply with changing market requirements. 

The total budget for FLEGT Asia (2013-2019) is 11.9 million Euro. Earmarked funding for FLEGT Asia comes from; European Commission (EC) 4.8 million Euro, the Netherlands 1 million Euro and Sweden 4 million Euro. Deficit financing is presently 2.1 million Euro. EFI says that the Netherlands is planning to extend and enhance its support and Finland have expressed interest. In addition, FLEGT Asia has great opportunity to get the support of non-earmarked money from the EU FLEGT Facility if the Steering Committee so decides, which already takes place.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the EU Facility level, according to mid-term progress report January-June 2020, key highlight of delivery results are, for example: - One formal&#xA0;Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) negotiation took place between the EU and C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire&#xA0;while the planned negotiation with Laos and Thailand were postponed. In spite of the challenges by the corona crisis, in many countries, the commitment to the VPA&#xA0;process remained strong. - Progress was made at the technical level, for example:&#xA0;the revision at the thematic group on Timber Legality Assurance Systems&#xA0;(TLAS)&#xA0;and the legality definition in Cameroon and Thailand;&#xA0;the setting up a new thematic group on TLAS&#xA0;and the legality definition in&#xA0;C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire;&#xA0;and regulatory&#xA0;revisions in Indonesia.&#xA0; - A lot of desk-based work have been done, e.g. the Facility updated all its FLEGT&#xA0;country webpages on its website, captured evidence in areas of governance applicable to FLEGT&#xA0;or VPA&#xA0;processes in partner countries, documented the impact of trainings of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the Mekong region and published impact stories&#xA0;related the VPA&#xA0;processes in Ghana and Thailand.&#xA0; For&#xA0;Sida Special Work&#xA0;on Regional Asia and MSMEs,&#xA0;EFI made progress in the documentation and dissemination of lessons learned of the MSMEs work. EFI published the paper Small and Micro-sized entities in the Mekong region&#x2019;s forest sector and raised awareness about the MSME work in regional fora such as the Asia Pacific Forestry Week, the 7th TLAS Workshop in late&#xA0;2019 in Indonesia and&#xA0;in APEC Experts Group on Illegal Logging and Associated Trade&#xA0;meeting in Malaysia in early 2020.&#xA0; Gender equality was strengthened through a gender workshop&#xA0;organized by WOCAN under the Regional Asia gender helpdesk framework. EFI&#xA0;informed that the workshop was successful&#xA0;and received positive feedback from their participants. The training took a hands-on approach and was a good balance of theoretical introductions to key concepts in gender, tools for gender analysis, and group work to practice the tools. One good lesson learned&#xA0;is that prior to the training, EFI had three meetings with the WOCAN&#xA0;to underline the objectives of the training, share information about participants, introduce the SmE work and FLEGT.&#xA0; EFI&#xA0;informed that the regional work supported by Sida until the end of 2020 will become part of the new FLEGT Asia program and contribute to the dialogue between the EU and ASEAN+3. This means that&#xA0;financial resource for Sida&#xA0;special work can be more&#xA0;focused on the MSME&#xA0;activities and linking to regional level while the Regional Asia work will still be implementing from the EU resources.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New/additional funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
DKT International (US-based non-for-profit) have submitted an application for a regional programme to contribute to improved sexual and reproductive health and rights in six countries in the region (Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Mozambique). Focus is on decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies and the availability to safe abortion. By increasing peoples access to a wide range of contraceptives, like IUD and implants, one contributes to their opportunities to decide over their own bodies and fertility. The programme is also specifically focused on young people through efforts to reduce teenage pregnancies and this is intended to help reduce the maternal mortality rates. The programme will also complement the programmes implemented through existing health systems and the public sector which often suffers from lack of resources. This complementing programme with the private sector is intended to contribute to reduced poverty and in the end support economic development. 

The six countries have demographical similarities when it comes to the large number of Young people, high maternal mortality rates and a huge unmet need for information and health services related to sexual and reproductive health and rights. Access to and the use of modern contraceptives (Contraceptive Prevalence Rates - CPR) is for example in Uganda only 8%. In Ethiopia, which is the second most populated country in Africa with approximately 100 million people, more than 66% are young below 25 years. In Tanzania more than 50% are below the age of 18 and the trend is similar in the remaining countries. There is therefore a great potential to increase the market in the region on access to contraceptives and especially among young people given the demographic similarities. There is also a big potential to build on already ongoing initiatives and existing programmes which DKT is implementing in these six countries.  

This regional programme is planned to complement programmes at bilateral in those countries where Sida is working on SRHR. Initial discussions have been held with the Embassies in Kinshasa, Maputo and Dar es Salam. Continuous consultations will be held with these as well as with the Embassies in Kampala and Addis Ababa. There are also clear Connections to Sidas global programme support to strategic partners such as IPAS and IPPF who are also working on SRHR, contraceptives and abortion. Synergies will be explored throughout the programme and there is also a firm interest from DKT International to look at potential connections and collaborations at bilateral level as well as with Sidas partners at global level,of which many are already established collaborating partners with DKT International. 

DKT International are well established as one of the worlds&apos; main organisations with expertise in Contraceptive Social Marketing (CSM). In Ethiopia DKT is running the largest programme in the country on contraceptives and safe abortion since 1990 and it also represents the third largest CSM programme in the World. The proposed programme is over 4 years (2016-2020) and has a budget of a total 80 million SEK and Sida is the first and so far only donor to this regional programme. This is based on the fact that there are very few regional SRHR-focused donors in the region and ever fewer that are focusing on access to safe and legal abortions. There is a possibility that other donors who has expressed an interest for this programme will contribute with funding later on. A potential support from Sida is expected to generate 28 million Couple Years Protection (CYP), which is a method used to estimate the protection against a pregnancy during one year by different contraceptive methods. Sidas support will be used for procurement of contraceptives, marketing and targeted youth activities. It will also be used to increase collaboration with the private health sector (clinics and pharmacies) to increase access to safe abortions wherever legal. 

The country offices are responsible for implementation and the head office in Washington DC bears the financial responsibility. The programme will mainly focus on large volumes of procured contraceptives and abortion-related medicines and Equipment as well as distribution of these through strategic marketing. It also finances training and competence-building for health staff, both within the public and the private sector with focus on SRHR and counseling. Special youth activities will also be implemented with the purpose to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and increase the knowledge about SRHR generally.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Nya medel/medeltill&#xE4;gg f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
DKT International (US-baserad non-profit organisation) har inkommit med en ans&#xF6;kan f&#xF6;r ett regionalt program f&#xF6;r att l&#xE5;ngsiktigt bidra till f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad sexuell och reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa och r&#xE4;ttigheter i sex l&#xE4;nder i regionen (Tanzania, Etiopien, Kenya, Uganda, Demokratiska Republiken Kongo, Mozambique). Fokus ligger p&#xE5; att minska antalet o&#xF6;nskade graviditeter och os&#xE4;kra aborter genom &#xF6;kad tillg&#xE5;ng till preventivmedel och erbjudandet av s&#xE4;ker abort. Genom att &#xF6;ka m&#xE4;nniskors tillg&#xE5;ng till ett utbud av preventivmedel inkl. fokus p&#xE5; l&#xE5;ngtidsverkande preventivmedel, s&#xE5;som tex. spiral och p-stav, bidrar man till deras m&#xF6;jlighet att sj&#xE4;lva best&#xE4;mma &#xF6;ver sin fertilitet. Insatsen avser ocks&#xE5; att s&#xE4;rskilt fokusera p&#xE5; ungdomar genom att bidra till ett minskat antal ton&#xE5;rsgraviditeter och detta avses bidra till minskade m&#xF6;drad&#xF6;dlighetssiffror. Insatsen bidrar &#xE4;ven till att komplettera de insatser som genomf&#xF6;rs genom befintliga h&#xE4;lsosystem och den offentliga sektorn som ofta lider av bristande resurser. Denna komplementerande insats inom privata sektorn avses bidra till minskad fattigdom och i slut&#xE4;ndan gynna ekonomisk utveckling. 

De sex l&#xE4;nderna har demografiskt stora likheter i vad det g&#xE4;ller ett stort antal unga m&#xE4;nniskor, h&#xF6;ga m&#xF6;drad&#xF6;dlighetssiffror och kraftigt undersatta behov av information och v&#xE5;rd n&#xE4;r det g&#xE4;ller sexuell och reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa och r&#xE4;ttigheter. Tillg&#xE5;ngen till och anv&#xE4;ndingen av moderna preventivmedel (Contraceptive Prevalence Rates - CPR) &#xE4;r tex. i Uganda endast 8%. I Etiopien, som &#xE4;r det andra mest befolkningst&#xE4;ta landet i Afrika med ca 100 miljoner m&#xE4;nniskor, utg&#xF6;r mer &#xE4;n 66% unga under 25 &#xE5;r. I Tanzania &#xE4;r &#xF6;ver 50% under 18 &#xE5;r och trenden ser liknande ut i de &#xF6;vriga l&#xE4;nderna. Det finns d&#xE4;rmed ett stort utrymme f&#xF6;r att bredda marknaden i regionen vad g&#xE4;ller tillg&#xE5;ngen till preventivmedel och speciellt bland unga, givet de demografiska likheterna. Det finns &#xE4;ven stor potential att bygga p&#xE5; redan tagna initiativ och p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende program som DKT implementerar i dessa sex l&#xE4;nder. 

Detta regionala program avser komplettera bilaterala insatser inom SRHR-omr&#xE5;det i de l&#xE4;nder d&#xE4;r Sida arbetar inom h&#xE4;lsa. Inledande dialog har f&#xF6;rst med ambassaderna i Kinshasa, Maputo och Dar es Salaam. Vidare konsultationer kommer att genomf&#xF6;ras med dessa samt med ambassaderna i Kampala och Addis Abeba. Det finns ocks&#xE5; tydliga kopplingar till Sidas globala st&#xF6;d till strategiskt viktiga organisationer som tex. International Pregnancy Advisory Services (IPAS) och International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) som ocks&#xE5; arbetar med SRHR, preventivmedel och abort. Synergier kommer att utvecklas vidare under programmets g&#xE5;ng och det finns ocks&#xE5; ett stort intresse fr&#xE5;n DKT International att n&#xE4;rmare utforska kopplingar och samarbeten p&#xE5; bilateral niv&#xE5;, s&#xE5;v&#xE4;l som med Sidas partners p&#xE5; global niv&#xE5;, varav flertalet redan &#xE4;r etablerade samarbetspartners med DKT International. 

DKT International &#xE4;r v&#xE4;l etablerade som en av v&#xE4;rldens fr&#xE4;msta organisationer med expertis inom Contraceptive Social Marketing (CSM). I Etiopien bedriver DKT International det st&#xF6;rsta programmet i landet inom preventivmedel och s&#xE4;ker abort sedan 1990 och det utg&#xF6;r &#xE4;ven det tredje st&#xF6;rsta programmet inom CSM i v&#xE4;rlden. Den f&#xF6;reslagna insatsen l&#xF6;per &#xF6;ver 4 &#xE5;r (2016-2020) och omfattar totalt 80 miljoner kronor och Sida &#xE4;r den f&#xF6;rsta och &#xE4;n s&#xE5; l&#xE4;nge enda finansi&#xE4;ren till detta regionala program. Detta grundar sig i att det f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande finns mycket f&#xE5; regionala SRHR-inriktade givare i regionen och &#xE4;nnu f&#xE4;rre som fokuserar p&#xE5; tillg&#xE5;ng till s&#xE4;ker abort. Det finns dock en m&#xF6;jlighet att andra givare som uttryckt intresse f&#xF6;r programmet kommer att bidra med st&#xF6;d fram&#xF6;ver. Ett potentiellt st&#xF6;d fr&#xE5;n Sida ber&#xE4;knas genererera 28 miljoner Couple Years Protection (CYP), vilket &#xE4;r en m&#xE4;tmetod f&#xF6;r att uppskatta skyddet mot graviditet under ett &#xE5;r av olika typer av preventivmedel. Sidas st&#xF6;d kommer att g&#xE5; till upphandling av preventivmedel, marknadsf&#xF6;ring och s&#xE4;rskilda ungdomssatsningar. Det kommer ocks&#xE5; att g&#xE5; till att ut&#xF6;ka samarbeten med privata h&#xE4;lsosektorn (bl.a. kliniker och apotek) f&#xF6;r att &#xF6;ka tillg&#xE5;ngen till s&#xE4;kra aborter d&#xE4;r detta &#xE4;r lagligt. 

Landkontoren har ansvar f&#xF6;r implementering av verksamheten och huvudkontoret i Washington DC b&#xE4;r det finansiella ansvaret. Programmet finansierar i huvudsak ink&#xF6;p av stora volymer preventivmedel och abort-relaterade mediciner och utrustning samt distribuering av dessa genom strategisk marknadsf&#xF6;ring. Det finansierar &#xE4;ven utbildning och kompetensh&#xF6;jande insatser f&#xF6;r sjukv&#xE5;rdspersonal, b&#xE5;de inom offentlig och privat sektor med fokus p&#xE5; SRHR och r&#xE5;dgivning. S&#xE4;rskilda ungdomssatsningar kommer ocks&#xE5; att genomf&#xF6;ras med syftet att f&#xE5; ner antalet o&#xF6;nskade graviditeter samt &#xF6;ka kunskapen om SRHR generellt.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme by DKT International aims to reverse the high number of unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions by ensuring that a wide range of contraceptive methods are available, affordable and of high quality. The programme also intends to increase access to safe abortion services (where legal) including post-abortion care (PAC) counselling and SRHR information. By expanding the scale and scope of the procurement of contraceptives, to prevent regular stock-outs of commodities, more women and men will have a broader access to a wide range of contraceptive methods.
In addition to focusing on supply of contraceptives and medical abortion products, strategic marketing and brand-building that caters to different segments of the population, creates demand. By reducing the barriers to accessing contraceptives and informing the general public of the value of using contraceptives, DKT operates from the assumption that many people will ultimately use their own funds to pay for the products and services they want as long as they are affordable and accessible. This has proven to be the fact in many countries around the world, where DKT is operating and even in low-income countries. 
The poorest of the poor and those who do not have the money to pay for contraceptives or health services are often targeted by other NGOs, UN, donors (for example with free condoms) and governments themselves. DKT does not claim to target this segment of the population as the prime objective of the programme. They do however also focus on the poor, underserved communities and high-risk groups and they engage with young people through different marketing strategies to reach those who are not able to pay and they also procure commodities which are distributed for free by other organisations.
The intended outcome of this programme is to increase the contraceptive prevalence rates through increased number of Couple Years Protection (CYP) and reduced costs per CYP as well as ensuring safe abortion services are available wherever legal. Sida funds will result in increased sales and services and contribute to the drive for health impact with focus on reduced number of unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions with a general impact on peoples&apos; SRHR.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, DKT generated over 6.4 million CYPs (109% of target) through the sale to the private and public sectors (including NGOs) of more than 98.3 million condoms, 6.2 million cycles of oral contraceptives, 4.6 million emergency contraceptives, 4.1 million injectables, 488,000 implants, 254,000 IUDs, 1.7 million tablets of misoprostol, 544,000 medical abortion (MA) combipacks, and 7,600 MVA kits in East and Southern Africa (see table 1 below). These sales helped to avert 1.1 million unintended pregnancies, 7,473 maternal deaths, 24,158 child deaths, and 1.2 million unsafe abortions (see table 2 below for health impact).&#xA0;  &#xA0; Table 2: Health impact 2019 in East and Southern Africa &#xA0;  DKT developed an e-learning module for provider training on comprehensive safe abortion care and over 3,201 health providers (target for 2019 was 175) completed it in 2019 (source appendix 3). DKT also trained 65 &quot;community mobilizers&quot; (target was 24) and 87 Youth Ambassadors (target was 45). DKT also met or exceeded in all countries targets for affordability (where products fall within the .25% of GNP PPP per capita). In DRC, DKT launched an MA combi-pack which was a first for DRC after the government ratified the Maputo Protocol. DKT also expanded reach to 206 government health zones (over 142 from 2018) as a result of the support from Sweden, and DKT&#x2019;s growth outpaced current contraceptive use estimates. DKT is one of the most important providers of SRH products and services in the country. In Ethiopia, where a large anonymous donor cut DKT&#x2019;s funding significantly (and eliminated funding for non-governmental organization partners entirely), DKT was unable to continue supplying commodities to partners and the Government. The country&#x2019;s political and economic fragility also contributed to a challenging work environment, restricting sales and user growth, but DKT still managed to grow private sector social marketing sales by 5% between 2018 and 2019. By year&#x2019;s end, modern contraceptive prevalence (mCPR) was recorded at 37.8%, towards which DKT&#x2019;s contributed 25.7 percentage points.&#xA0; Other results of interest could be seen in DKT&apos;s leverage of its online platforms, Women First Digital, which in addition to providing vital information on SRHR also provided a space to challenge abortion stigma, reinforce women&apos;s rights and spread news about reproductive health and rights successes globally. Examples provided by DKT for Eastern and Southern Africa in 2019 include: - Ending Abortion Stigma: Role of Media - Talking about abortions: how safe2choose shaped the online and offline conversations in 2019 (including at the 2019 Women Deliver conference) - The role of schools in bridging the abortion information gap - To Be Or Not To Be: Abortion in Zambia (note that DKT does not operate in Zambia) - New Landmark Abortion Ruling In Kenya  In addition, following close dialogue with Sida and the recommendations from an MTR in 2018, DKT has seen a strengthened regional approach which it acknowledges has improved the programme&apos;s ability to deliver results through internal knowledge sharing, partnerships, case-studies on barriers to safe abortion promotion in different country contexts, sustainability and economies of scale. DKT held a pan-Africa meeting for all senior managers in 2019 (inspired by the MTR) which led to a five-year plan for the region as a whole.&#xA0; The sharing of information focused on sustainability, common branding and collaboration and led to increased efficiencies and regional partnerships.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att bek&#xE4;mpa covid-19
EAC-sekretariatet has ans&#xF6;kt om st&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r ett integrerat regionalt h&#xE4;lsoprogram under 2016-2020.

Programmets syfte &#xE4;r att, p&#xE5; policyniv&#xE5;, hantera svagheter inom medleml&#xE4;ndernas h&#xE4;lsosystem. Om EACs medlemsl&#xE4;nder gemensamt och effektivt harmoniserar standarder f&#xF6;r SRHR-, m&#xF6;dra-, barn-och HIV/AIDS-h&#xE4;lsotj&#xE4;nster kommer detta att st&#xE4;rka det regional samarbetet inom h&#xE4;lsa. Vidare syftar interventionen till att st&#xE4;rka relevant forskning, innovationer, kunskapsspridning, ledarskap, styrning och ansvarsutkr&#xE4;vande inom regionen. EAC f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntar sig att det l&#xE5;ngsiktiga resultatet av ett f&#xF6;rdjupat samarbete inom ovan n&#xE4;mnda omr&#xE5;den kommer att vara att snabbare n&#xE5; m&#xE5;len om att eliminera den m&#xF6;dra- och barnad&#xF6;dlighet som g&#xE5;r att f&#xF6;rhindra och att p&#xE5; sikt stoppa AIDS-epidemin. 

Projektet har en budget p&#xE5; 45 miljoner kronor &#xF6;ver 4,25 &#xE5;r och Sida &#xE4;r den enda givaren. Projektet &#xE4;r en del av EAC-sekretariatets mer &#xF6;vergripande h&#xE4;lsostrategi som omfattar &#xE4;ven andra givare. Huvuddelen av projektets kostnader omfattas av l&#xF6;ner f&#xF6;r anst&#xE4;llda vid EAC-sekretariatet samt kostnader f&#xF6;r de processer som framtagande av EAC-gemensamma policydokument inneb&#xE4;r (m&#xF6;teskostnader, resor m.m).</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The EAC secretariat has applied for support to the EAC-Sida integrated health program 2016-2020.

The purpose of the program is to, at a policy level, address weaknesses of member states&apos; health systems. If the member states collectively and effectively harmonize standards for SRHR- maternal-, child and HIV/AIDS health services this will in turn strengthen regional cooperation in health. Furthermore, the program seeks to strengthen relevant research, innovation, knowledge management, leadership, governance and accountability within the region. The EAC expects that the long-term outcome of a deeper collaboration in the abovementioned areas will be that the goals of eliminating preventable maternal- and child mortality and eventually ending the AIDS-epidemic can be reached faster. 

The project has a budget of 45 million SEK over 4.25 years and Sida is the sole donor. The project part of the EAC-secretariats more overarching health strategy which includes also other donors. The majority of costs are represented by salaries of project staff at the EAC-secretariat and costs related to development of EAC policies (e.g. workshops, travels, consultancy fees)</narrative>

Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The contribution consists of support to a Challenge Fund; REACT (Renewable Energy, Adaptation and Climate Change Technology). REACT - sub-Saharan Africa, is administered by Afica Enterprise Challenge Fund Ltd (AECF), a non-profit company with AGRA (African Green Revolution) as the sole owner/member. AGRA is a &quot;&#x201C;non profit organization registered in Washington State as a public charity&#x201D;. The contribution includes components in seven of Sweden&apos;s cooperation countries and the regional strategy for sub-Saharan Africa.

The objective of REACT is to stimulate small and medium-sized companies, to develop business models, services and products in renewable energy and energy efficiency that improve the lives of the poor. The idea is that companies supported by REACT are prepared to take risks, which they otherwise would not take. The ideas put forward by the companies, are identified through competitions in the respective countries. Applications are assessed on the basis of clear and transparent criteria and in three separate steps - this, to assure an independent and transparent process. REACT also supports capacity development of enterprises in a variety of areas, brokering service for successful companies to access capital for scaling up, learning and advocacy on national and regional issues (laws, rules, licensing, trade barriers etc.).

The decision on the intervention covers five years and amounts to 400 000 000 SEK.</narrative>

Programmet str&#xE4;var efter att minska effekterna av klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar i Bangladesh. IPCC(International Panel on Climate Change) rankar Bangladesh som det sj&#xE4;tte mest utsatta landet i v&#xE4;rlden f&#xF6;r klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar och det land som &#xE4;r mest utsatt f&#xF6;r h&#xF6;jningen av havsniv&#xE5;n (undantaget sm&#xE5; &#xF6;-riken). F&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar av nederb&#xF6;rden f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas leda till b&#xE5;de fler och sv&#xE5;rare &#xF6;versv&#xE4;mningar samt till perioder av torka i vissa omr&#xE5;den. Intr&#xE4;ngning av havsvatten samt fler och kraftigare cykloner &#xF6;kar risken f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rh&#xF6;jd saltkoncentration i mark, floder och grundvattnet. Bangladesh regering uppskattar att de fem st&#xF6;rsta naturkatastroferna sen 1998 har minskat BNP med 15%. &#xC5;terkommande katastrofer har st&#xF6;rst p&#xE5;verkar p&#xE5; den fattigaste delen av befolkningen och bidrar till en i vissa omr&#xE5;den cementerad fattigdomsproblematik. 

Bangladesh har varit ett f&#xF6;reg&#xE5;ngsland n&#xE4;r det g&#xE4;llde att ta fram strategiska planer f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta klimathotet (ex. National Adaptation Plan of Action - NAPA och Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan - BCCSAP) och att utveckla en nationell finansieringsmekanism f&#xF6;r klimatanpassning (Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund - BCCTF) men trots att lokala initiativ f&#xF6;r klimatanpassning identifieras som ett prioriterat omr&#xE5;de i b&#xE5;de BCCSAP och NAPA s&#xE5; har endast en liten del av &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta resursers implementerats av lokala myndigheter. Lokala klimatanpassningsprojekt som genomf&#xF6;rs med en f&#xF6;rankring hos befolkningen kan med relativt sm&#xE5; medel minska utsattheten hos s&#xE5;rbara delar av befolkningen och medf&#xF6;r ofta mindre risker &#xE4;n storskaliga infrastruktursatsningar. 

UNDP och UNCDF har gemensamt utvecklat programmet (LoGIC) som avser att st&#xE4;rka lokala myndigheters kapacitet att integrera klimatanpassning i lokala utvecklingsplaner, f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra nationella mekanismer f&#xF6;r lokal klimatfinansiering och implementera klimatanpassnings&#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder som har identifierats i samr&#xE5;d mellan lokala myndigheter och lokalbefolkningen. Civilsamh&#xE4;llets har en viktig funktion n&#xE4;r det kommer till att mobilisera lokalbefolkningen och verka f&#xF6;r transparens och ansvarsutkr&#xE4;vande gentemot lokal myndigheter och har d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r en tydlig roll i programmet. 

Programmet p&#xE5;g&#xE5;r under 48 m&#xE5;nader och har en budget p&#xE5; c:a USD 20 milj., Sidas bidrag uppg&#xE5;r till 85 milj. kr vilket motsvarar ungef&#xE4;r h&#xE4;lften av programbudgeten och EU har redan beslutat om ett st&#xF6;d p&#xE5; &#x20AC; 8 miljoner. Programmet &#xE4;r fullfinansierat men m&#xF6;jligheten finns att skala upp programmet om ytterligare givare skulle ansluta. Programmets &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att st&#xE4;rka finansieringsmekanismer och planeringsprocesser f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra implementering av klimatfinansiering av lokala myndigheter som f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas att bidra till fattigdomsbek&#xE4;mpning och minskad utsatthet hos den fattigare delen av befolkningen. C:a 60% av budget avser bidrag till lokala myndigheter och bidrag direkt till utsatta hush&#xE5;ll f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av resiliensh&#xF6;jande &#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder. Bidragsdelen uppskattas gynna 200 000 utsatt hush&#xE5;ll i 72 Union Parishad, i 7 Distrikt, som har bed&#xF6;mts vara mycket utsatta f&#xF6;r klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar och ha en stor fattigdomsproblematik.

Division of Local Government (LGD) under Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives kommer att ha det &#xF6;vergripande ansvaret f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av programmet enligt en etablerad samarbetsform mellan UNDP och Bangladsh regering. En styrgrupp f&#xF6;r projektet kommer att tills&#xE4;ttas med deltagare fr&#xE5;n Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, finansministeriet, milj&#xF6;ministeriet, och andra ber&#xF6;rda departement. Strygruppenkommer att ansvara f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vergirpande syryning av programmet och godk&#xE4;nna projektplaner. UNDP och UNCDF kommer tillsammans hantera en Project Management Unit best&#xE5;ende av nationell och internationell personal f&#xF6;r att st&#xF6;dja LGD i genomf&#xF6;randet av programmet under ledning av en National Project Director.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The project will address climate change impact in Bangladesh. The country is ranked 6th among the 10 countries of the world most affected by climate change and disasters and the country most at risk for sea level rise (with the exeption of small island states). It is experiencing change in rainfall, rise in temperature, and is often battered by extreme weather events like cyclones, floods and rise in sea level which compound into raised salinity of water resources and soil. A government estimate indicates that in five major disasters since 1998, the country suffered a loss of nearly 15% of GDP. These events exacerbate poverty and vulnerability of people on a regular basis. 

The Government of Bangladesh already recognises the severity of climate change and therefore, the related concerns are being gradually mainstreamed in the national development policy planning and financing. The Government has formulated a national action plan (BCCSAP) that provides core programme direction. However, this sector is served by a number of sectoral policies which also shape the expenditure pattern in the national budget. While the local government institutions (LGIs) are mandated to implement many actions related to climate effects, these actions need to be included in the local plans as climate proofing initiatives.  

The proposed programme will address gaps at local and national levels based on which the results have been designed. At the local level, despite being a repository of local knowledge and information, the LGIs fall short of harnessing the potentials from the local community. The mechanism for formulation of the Local Development Plans (LDP) has scope to engage the poor and vulnerable groups in a participatory way to reflect their climate-related needs and demands.  Communities and households face difficulties in securing access to the planning and financing mechanism for sustainable development solutions. On the other hand, the Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)  and local institutions  who have long been functioning at local level for enhanced participation and accountability also shy off the process owing to lack of appropriate capacity. An in-depth analysis of the potentials and the gaps was carried out to identify the intervention areas at the local level. 

The duration of the programme is 4 years, 2016-2020, with a total budget of US$ 20.0 million and a planned contribution of approximately USD 10 million (85 million SEK) by Sida and an already approved contribution of &#x20AC; 8 million by the EU. The project will enhance the capacity of vulnerable communities, local government institutions and civil society organisations for planning and financing climate change adaptation solutions in selected climate vulnerable areas. By achieving the objectives and results, the project will contribute to the reduction of poverty and vulnerability in Bangladesh. 

This is expected to to result in:
-Strengthened capacity of vulnerable people and local stakeholders for accountable planning and financing on Climate Change Adaptation/Disaster Risk Reduction actions for building resilience.
-Enhanced access of LGIs and vulnerable households to climate funds have for climate resilient infrastructures and adaptive livelihoods.
-Established evidence based advocacy for a mechanism for financing local resilience.

The programme is designed to benefit roughly 200,000 most vulnerable households in 72 unions in seven districts. The benefits are expected to come out of climate change adaptation actions at various levels, scaled up through local government institutions incorporating high quality accountability and participation of the most vulnerable people. 

The Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives will be the implementing agency and will assume overall responsibility for management and implementation of the project in a manner consistent with GoB and UNDP polices. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be formed with the participation of Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief , Ministry of Finance, Ministry Environment and Forest, and other relevant ministries. The PSC will be responsible for consensus management decisions for the project when guidance is required, including approval of project plans and revisions. UNDP and UNCDF will jointly manage a Project Management Unit comprised of national and international staff members to support the LGD to implement the project, under the guidance of National Project Director.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This conclusion on performance covers the year 2019 and also covers the entire project implementation to draw a overall conclusion on performance as Embassy is planning for a costed extension of the contribution. This GoB-EU-SIDA-UNDP-UNCDF is a multi-donor joint project in Bangladesh plans to promote local action on climate change adaptation at scale. This project was initially developed as a concept together by EU, SIDA, UNDP and UNCDF during 2014-2016 along with Local Government Division. EU developed the initial action fiche in consultation with UNDP, UNCDF and LGD. The action fiche titled &#x201C;GCCA+ support for enhancing communities&apos; resilience to climate change and related disasters&#x201D; was approved in 2015 in European Parliament. In 2015, Sida joined in the design team and collectively developed the project titled &#x201C;Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC)&#x201D;. In 2016, the project was signed with GoB with the financial support of GoB [BDT. 60,000,000 equivalent to USD 714285], EU [EURO 8,000,000 equivalent to USD 8,968,610], SIDA [SEK 85,000,000 equivalent to USD 9,902,144], UNCDF [USD 200,000] and UNDP [USD 200,000]. This project is implemented by UNDP and UNCDF and executed by Local Government Division. This project was initially designed for 4 years and now based on an independent assessment of EU and success of initial results, the project will be extended for another 30 months including a 6 months closing period. Government of Bangladesh aims to make this project a flagship project in developing a climate finance mechanism/model to deliver climate finance for the most vulnerable for building local resilience and therefore, titled the project as &#x201C;Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC)&#x201D; following UNDP&#x2019;s Joint Project Document Framework. This Conclusion on Performance has been prepared based on their annual reports, two field visits conducted and participation in different meetings and informal discussions with GoB, UNDP, UNCDF and Project staff. There has been no mid-term evaluation conducted for this project but end of 2019 EU conducted an assessment of the project. This assessment report also provides a basis for this CoP. With a delayed start, the projects accomplishment was very encouraging during 2018, 2019 and 2020. The project made a good progress towards establishing the approach and mechanisms. Some of the process and mehtodological achievements.&#xA0; Establishing the LoGIC Model as key delivery mechanism: In delivering climate finance to the most vulnerable, LoGIC project has emerged as a system by now. It has evolved as the model for identifying the most vulnerable, be it the household or the local government institutions (Union Parishads) and building resilience of them. Selection of 72 most vulnerable, physically disconnected and hardest-to-reach Union Parishads frequently affected by climate change variabilities and extremes (cyclone, sea level rise, salinity, flood and flash flood) is justified by national vulnerability ranking and hard-to-reach mapping, also acknowledged by the government and the other stakeholders. The rigorous project facilitation for carrying out the technical and participatory Community Risk Assessment (CRA) exercise founded the stone for designing the long-term strategic climate actions for the local government institutions (LGIs). Direct transfer of grants to these most vulnerable institutions for implementing project actions (through the Performance Based Climate Resilience Grants- PBCRG) and individual households (Community Resilience Fund- CRF) made the process roll. The effectiveness of the PBCRG and CRF, in curving down the climate vulnerability of the people in high risk areas, is yet to be measured. The LoGIC project enhanced the financial inclusion of the most vulnerable 17,000 women, who never thought of having access to the formal banking system. It has resulted in enhanced confidence among the women participants expressed, through their empowerment and internalizing meaningful ways in building resilience. The other co-benefit is the economic and social empowerment of the women. Women are not alone while they implement their adaptive livelihood options but are in groups with unified business plans to reduce their investment risks. This has created enthusiasm among the local stakeholders to engage in the process of resilience building. Now, the project needs to measure the impact of the PBCRG and CRF in reducing the climate change induced vulnerability of the most vulnerable people. When the system is established, it is important that the climate change attribution to the model is strengthened and ensure to proof the model in relation to the reduction of vulnerabilities in the next two years, so that it is scalable to more than 200 climate vulnerable UPs by 2023, with support from Green Climate Fund (GCF), Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and other non-vertical development partners. Mainstreaming adaptation (resilience) at the local level: LoGIC, through the CRA process, facilitated the participatory representation of the LGIs and the vulnerable communities. This helped brainstorm and identify their risks, which was prioritized at the planning exercise and incorporated in the long-term strategic plan of the Union Parishads (UPs). While UPs plan on building public goods for climate resilience (Risk Reduction Action Plan or RRAP), the community, on the other hand, plan for their own adaptive livelihood options (HHRRAP) for the same. Out of 72, targeted 71 UPs have received PBCRG grants (USD 1.79M) for implementing 228 climate change adaptation (CCA) schemes from their RRAP to create climate resilient public goods. There is potential for scaling up nature-based solutions with support from other sources such as philanthropists, development agencies, local community etc. to finance resilience and adaptation at the community level. On the other hand, 17,000 households of the community in 1,070 groups (based on interest, convenience, homogeneity choices, geographic proximity and communication) received USD 4.64M (2.88m disbursed in 2019, and 1.76m disbursed in 2018) and came up with 22 types of gender-responsive adaptive livelihood options. Adaptation actions at household level through CRF, who are most vulnerable and often left out from public goods benefits and widening the community scale adaptation micro-projects to reduce the vulnerability to climate change both followed the community risk assessment methodology. The vulnerable households and community within the Local Government (LG) constituencies interact in such a manner that ultimately ensure readiness to tackle climate hazards and strengthens the means for survival of the vulnerable community. However, such links require further strengthening and be informed from science-led predictions and scenarios of climate-induced risks. While, the project is well articulated in terms of participatory CRA, what will be more beneficial for climate change adaptation in this regard is a top-down method blended approach in promoting science-driven, informed participation of community in prioritizing their adaptation options at household and community levels. Potential for scaling-up of climate resilient/adaptive livelihoods: The core process of the selection of vulnerable households include (1) CRA and RRAP, (2) based on CRA, identification of two/three vulnerable wards from each UP, (3) conducting the census in these 147 wards, (4) identifying eligible beneficiaries (46,000) by minimum 0.5 vulnerability scores , (5) selection of relatively most vulnerable (26,000) households, with a primary shortlist (17000) and a waiting list (9000 HHs), (6) run a grievance register and redress mechanism and (7) finalize the 17000 HHs as final beneficiaries for the CRF. 98% of these HHs identified women member of the household as primary participant in the CRF and therefore, 16,660 are women as primary beneficiaries of CRF. These beneficiaries are pursuing 22 different types of climate resilient livelihoods in group enterprises, as a follow-up of the choices of the means of livelihoods and start-up grant support from the Project in two tranches. There are three (3) options to scale-up these livelihoods: (1) reaching to all eligible vulnerable groups (46,000 HHs) with different grants packages or reaching to all most vulnerable people (26,000 HHs) with common grant package; (2) scale-up of the most viable climate resilient livelihood options with formal credit market with higher environmental safeguard (i.e. crab fattening); and (3) facilitate private sector actors and co-design business case for scalable business opportunities on climate resilient means of livelihoods where vulnerable people secured income with backed-up skill training and social guarantee. A few examples include hydroponics, bio-flake, aquaponics, sunflower, crab-fattening, saline tolerant pulse, fruits and oil seeds production. Use of innovation for tracking and measuring adaptation: LoGIC demonstrates a comprehensive approach to ensure climate resilience. To keep records, track and measure adaptation, LoGIC has developed and put in place the state-of-the-art Accounting &amp;amp; Management Information Systems (MIS), Adaptation Tracking and Measuring (ATM) system for the project to make sure all the climate money are spent with rationale, the data are regularly entered and updated in the software which generates reports and tell stories of change in the field. Project&#x2019;s M&amp;amp;E system inculcates all the information from the software and the database to create reports. Tapping upon innovation towards maximizing results, project has successfully trained 72 Union Parishads (LGI) Secretary on Accounting &amp;amp; MIS software. Field level project staffs have been provided hands-on training on filed-level data entry in changing context, future risks, use of grants etc. in the app-Tab-based ATM software. This approach has started to evolve as a transparent and accountable tool to measure climate change and adaptation data on the ground. Sustainable Development Goals: Progressing towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has been pressing for more attention towards environmental issues. Of the 17 proposed SDGs, four (4) are related to climate change and environment and LoGIC contributes to or works towards Goals 1, 5, 10, 11, 13 and 16, i.e. contributing towards poverty eradiation, gender equality, sustainable communities, reduced inequalities, stronger institutions and climate change, broadly. LoGIC is working towards Goal 13.3, which is aimed to improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning through indicators (13.3.1 and 13.3.2). Likewise, with 13.2, i.e. to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. Although LoGIC has been working towards Goals 1, 5, 10, 11 and 16, only Goal 13 is included in the Strategic Results Framework. Specific achievements against goals are being studied and will be compiled for reporting. During the period, in early March 2020 a joint field visit was made to the project sites at Barguna district for five days. The joint mission was composed of EU, UNDP, UNCDF, GoB and Embassy of Sweden. Overall the findings were impressive. The third Project Steering Committee meeting took place virtually on 12 August 2020 chaired by the Senior Secretary, Local Government Division, Ministry of Local Government. Where relevant government ministry and departments participated. The meeting agreed and advocated for the top up and 2 years extension (up to 30 June 2023), expressed their commitment by agreeing to add 100 MBDT (about 1.2 MUSD) from GoB. Both EU and Embassy of Sweden participated in the meeting. Some major accomplishments 1. Community Risk Assessment (CRA) completed for 147 words in 72 Unions, 17,000 most vulnerable identified and listed in a through participatory manner. Among them 98% are female 2. Vulnerability identified for 147 words, 3. Climate resilient livelihood identified for 17,000 most vulnerable, transferred 1st tranche of Community Resilience Fund (CRF) through formal banking process. All these very remote area people have their bank account now with a formal bank. 4. Capacity enhancement activities done for all these 17,000 people 5. 243 climate resilient schemes implemented under the Performance Based Climate Resilient Grant (PBCRG) through Union Councils. Capacity enhancement of these Union parishad officials done 6. Information on Covid 19 disseminated to all the communities using different media and community well-being information collected from all the communities 7. 11 issues identified and ready for policy advocacy, so far 1 successful policy advocacy event completed with very good government buy inn.</narrative>

Programmet str&#xE4;var efter att minska effekterna av klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar i Bangladesh. IPCC(International Panel on Climate Change) rankar Bangladesh som det sj&#xE4;tte mest utsatta landet i v&#xE4;rlden f&#xF6;r klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar och det land som &#xE4;r mest utsatt f&#xF6;r h&#xF6;jningen av havsniv&#xE5;n (undantaget sm&#xE5; &#xF6;-riken). F&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar av nederb&#xF6;rden f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas leda till b&#xE5;de fler och sv&#xE5;rare &#xF6;versv&#xE4;mningar samt till perioder av torka i vissa omr&#xE5;den. Intr&#xE4;ngning av havsvatten samt fler och kraftigare cykloner &#xF6;kar risken f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rh&#xF6;jd saltkoncentration i mark, floder och grundvattnet. Bangladesh regering uppskattar att de fem st&#xF6;rsta naturkatastroferna sen 1998 har minskat BNP med 15%. &#xC5;terkommande katastrofer har st&#xF6;rst p&#xE5;verkar p&#xE5; den fattigaste delen av befolkningen och bidrar till en i vissa omr&#xE5;den cementerad fattigdomsproblematik. 

Bangladesh har varit ett f&#xF6;reg&#xE5;ngsland n&#xE4;r det g&#xE4;llde att ta fram strategiska planer f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;ta klimathotet (ex. National Adaptation Plan of Action - NAPA och Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan - BCCSAP) och att utveckla en nationell finansieringsmekanism f&#xF6;r klimatanpassning (Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund - BCCTF) men trots att lokala initiativ f&#xF6;r klimatanpassning identifieras som ett prioriterat omr&#xE5;de i b&#xE5;de BCCSAP och NAPA s&#xE5; har endast en liten del av &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta resursers implementerats av lokala myndigheter. Lokala klimatanpassningsprojekt som genomf&#xF6;rs med en f&#xF6;rankring hos befolkningen kan med relativt sm&#xE5; medel minska utsattheten hos s&#xE5;rbara delar av befolkningen och medf&#xF6;r ofta mindre risker &#xE4;n storskaliga infrastruktursatsningar. 

UNDP och UNCDF har gemensamt utvecklat programmet (LoGIC) som avser att st&#xE4;rka lokala myndigheters kapacitet att integrera klimatanpassning i lokala utvecklingsplaner, f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra nationella mekanismer f&#xF6;r lokal klimatfinansiering och implementera klimatanpassnings&#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder som har identifierats i samr&#xE5;d mellan lokala myndigheter och lokalbefolkningen. Civilsamh&#xE4;llets har en viktig funktion n&#xE4;r det kommer till att mobilisera lokalbefolkningen och verka f&#xF6;r transparens och ansvarsutkr&#xE4;vande gentemot lokal myndigheter och har d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r en tydlig roll i programmet. 

Programmet p&#xE5;g&#xE5;r under 48 m&#xE5;nader och har en budget p&#xE5; c:a USD 20 milj., Sidas bidrag uppg&#xE5;r till 85 milj. kr vilket motsvarar ungef&#xE4;r h&#xE4;lften av programbudgeten och EU har redan beslutat om ett st&#xF6;d p&#xE5; &#x20AC; 8 miljoner. Programmet &#xE4;r fullfinansierat men m&#xF6;jligheten finns att skala upp programmet om ytterligare givare skulle ansluta. Programmets &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;l &#xE4;r att st&#xE4;rka finansieringsmekanismer och planeringsprocesser f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra implementering av klimatfinansiering av lokala myndigheter som f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas att bidra till fattigdomsbek&#xE4;mpning och minskad utsatthet hos den fattigare delen av befolkningen. C:a 60% av budget avser bidrag till lokala myndigheter och bidrag direkt till utsatta hush&#xE5;ll f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av resiliensh&#xF6;jande &#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder. Bidragsdelen uppskattas gynna 200 000 utsatt hush&#xE5;ll i 72 Union Parishad, i 7 Distrikt, som har bed&#xF6;mts vara mycket utsatta f&#xF6;r klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar och ha en stor fattigdomsproblematik.

Division of Local Government (LGD) under Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives kommer att ha det &#xF6;vergripande ansvaret f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av programmet enligt en etablerad samarbetsform mellan UNDP och Bangladsh regering. En styrgrupp f&#xF6;r projektet kommer att tills&#xE4;ttas med deltagare fr&#xE5;n Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, finansministeriet, milj&#xF6;ministeriet, och andra ber&#xF6;rda departement. Strygruppenkommer att ansvara f&#xF6;r &#xF6;vergirpande syryning av programmet och godk&#xE4;nna projektplaner. UNDP och UNCDF kommer tillsammans hantera en Project Management Unit best&#xE5;ende av nationell och internationell personal f&#xF6;r att st&#xF6;dja LGD i genomf&#xF6;randet av programmet under ledning av en National Project Director.</narrative>

The project will address climate change impact in Bangladesh. The country is ranked 6th among the 10 countries of the world most affected by climate change and disasters and the country most at risk for sea level rise (with the exeption of small island states). It is experiencing change in rainfall, rise in temperature, and is often battered by extreme weather events like cyclones, floods and rise in sea level which compound into raised salinity of water resources and soil. A government estimate indicates that in five major disasters since 1998, the country suffered a loss of nearly 15% of GDP. These events exacerbate poverty and vulnerability of people on a regular basis. 

The Government of Bangladesh already recognises the severity of climate change and therefore, the related concerns are being gradually mainstreamed in the national development policy planning and financing. The Government has formulated a national action plan (BCCSAP) that provides core programme direction. However, this sector is served by a number of sectoral policies which also shape the expenditure pattern in the national budget. While the local government institutions (LGIs) are mandated to implement many actions related to climate effects, these actions need to be included in the local plans as climate proofing initiatives.  

The proposed programme will address gaps at local and national levels based on which the results have been designed. At the local level, despite being a repository of local knowledge and information, the LGIs fall short of harnessing the potentials from the local community. The mechanism for formulation of the Local Development Plans (LDP) has scope to engage the poor and vulnerable groups in a participatory way to reflect their climate-related needs and demands.  Communities and households face difficulties in securing access to the planning and financing mechanism for sustainable development solutions. On the other hand, the Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)  and local institutions  who have long been functioning at local level for enhanced participation and accountability also shy off the process owing to lack of appropriate capacity. An in-depth analysis of the potentials and the gaps was carried out to identify the intervention areas at the local level. 

The duration of the programme is 4 years, 2016-2020, with a total budget of US$ 20.0 million and a planned contribution of approximately USD 10 million (85 million SEK) by Sida and an already approved contribution of &#x20AC; 8 million by the EU. The project will enhance the capacity of vulnerable communities, local government institutions and civil society organisations for planning and financing climate change adaptation solutions in selected climate vulnerable areas. By achieving the objectives and results, the project will contribute to the reduction of poverty and vulnerability in Bangladesh. 

This is expected to to result in:
-Strengthened capacity of vulnerable people and local stakeholders for accountable planning and financing on Climate Change Adaptation/Disaster Risk Reduction actions for building resilience.
-Enhanced access of LGIs and vulnerable households to climate funds have for climate resilient infrastructures and adaptive livelihoods.
-Established evidence based advocacy for a mechanism for financing local resilience.

The programme is designed to benefit roughly 200,000 most vulnerable households in 72 unions in seven districts. The benefits are expected to come out of climate change adaptation actions at various levels, scaled up through local government institutions incorporating high quality accountability and participation of the most vulnerable people. 

The Local Government Division (LGD) of the Ministry of Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives will be the implementing agency and will assume overall responsibility for management and implementation of the project in a manner consistent with GoB and UNDP polices. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be formed with the participation of Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief , Ministry of Finance, Ministry Environment and Forest, and other relevant ministries. The PSC will be responsible for consensus management decisions for the project when guidance is required, including approval of project plans and revisions. UNDP and UNCDF will jointly manage a Project Management Unit comprised of national and international staff members to support the LGD to implement the project, under the guidance of National Project Director.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">This conclusion on performance covers the year 2019 and also covers the entire project implementation to draw a overall conclusion on performance as Embassy is planning for a costed extension of the contribution. This GoB-EU-SIDA-UNDP-UNCDF is a multi-donor joint project in Bangladesh plans to promote local action on climate change adaptation at scale. This project was initially developed as a concept together by EU, SIDA, UNDP and UNCDF during 2014-2016 along with Local Government Division. EU developed the initial action fiche in consultation with UNDP, UNCDF and LGD. The action fiche titled &#x201C;GCCA+ support for enhancing communities&apos; resilience to climate change and related disasters&#x201D; was approved in 2015 in European Parliament. In 2015, Sida joined in the design team and collectively developed the project titled &#x201C;Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC)&#x201D;. In 2016, the project was signed with GoB with the financial support of GoB [BDT. 60,000,000 equivalent to USD 714285], EU [EURO 8,000,000 equivalent to USD 8,968,610], SIDA [SEK 85,000,000 equivalent to USD 9,902,144], UNCDF [USD 200,000] and UNDP [USD 200,000]. This project is implemented by UNDP and UNCDF and executed by Local Government Division. This project was initially designed for 4 years and now based on an independent assessment of EU and success of initial results, the project will be extended for another 30 months including a 6 months closing period. Government of Bangladesh aims to make this project a flagship project in developing a climate finance mechanism/model to deliver climate finance for the most vulnerable for building local resilience and therefore, titled the project as &#x201C;Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC)&#x201D; following UNDP&#x2019;s Joint Project Document Framework. This Conclusion on Performance has been prepared based on their annual reports, two field visits conducted and participation in different meetings and informal discussions with GoB, UNDP, UNCDF and Project staff. There has been no mid-term evaluation conducted for this project but end of 2019 EU conducted an assessment of the project. This assessment report also provides a basis for this CoP. With a delayed start, the projects accomplishment was very encouraging during 2018, 2019 and 2020. The project made a good progress towards establishing the approach and mechanisms. Some of the process and mehtodological achievements.&#xA0; Establishing the LoGIC Model as key delivery mechanism: In delivering climate finance to the most vulnerable, LoGIC project has emerged as a system by now. It has evolved as the model for identifying the most vulnerable, be it the household or the local government institutions (Union Parishads) and building resilience of them. Selection of 72 most vulnerable, physically disconnected and hardest-to-reach Union Parishads frequently affected by climate change variabilities and extremes (cyclone, sea level rise, salinity, flood and flash flood) is justified by national vulnerability ranking and hard-to-reach mapping, also acknowledged by the government and the other stakeholders. The rigorous project facilitation for carrying out the technical and participatory Community Risk Assessment (CRA) exercise founded the stone for designing the long-term strategic climate actions for the local government institutions (LGIs). Direct transfer of grants to these most vulnerable institutions for implementing project actions (through the Performance Based Climate Resilience Grants- PBCRG) and individual households (Community Resilience Fund- CRF) made the process roll. The effectiveness of the PBCRG and CRF, in curving down the climate vulnerability of the people in high risk areas, is yet to be measured. The LoGIC project enhanced the financial inclusion of the most vulnerable 17,000 women, who never thought of having access to the formal banking system. It has resulted in enhanced confidence among the women participants expressed, through their empowerment and internalizing meaningful ways in building resilience. The other co-benefit is the economic and social empowerment of the women. Women are not alone while they implement their adaptive livelihood options but are in groups with unified business plans to reduce their investment risks. This has created enthusiasm among the local stakeholders to engage in the process of resilience building. Now, the project needs to measure the impact of the PBCRG and CRF in reducing the climate change induced vulnerability of the most vulnerable people. When the system is established, it is important that the climate change attribution to the model is strengthened and ensure to proof the model in relation to the reduction of vulnerabilities in the next two years, so that it is scalable to more than 200 climate vulnerable UPs by 2023, with support from Green Climate Fund (GCF), Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and other non-vertical development partners. Mainstreaming adaptation (resilience) at the local level: LoGIC, through the CRA process, facilitated the participatory representation of the LGIs and the vulnerable communities. This helped brainstorm and identify their risks, which was prioritized at the planning exercise and incorporated in the long-term strategic plan of the Union Parishads (UPs). While UPs plan on building public goods for climate resilience (Risk Reduction Action Plan or RRAP), the community, on the other hand, plan for their own adaptive livelihood options (HHRRAP) for the same. Out of 72, targeted 71 UPs have received PBCRG grants (USD 1.79M) for implementing 228 climate change adaptation (CCA) schemes from their RRAP to create climate resilient public goods. There is potential for scaling up nature-based solutions with support from other sources such as philanthropists, development agencies, local community etc. to finance resilience and adaptation at the community level. On the other hand, 17,000 households of the community in 1,070 groups (based on interest, convenience, homogeneity choices, geographic proximity and communication) received USD 4.64M (2.88m disbursed in 2019, and 1.76m disbursed in 2018) and came up with 22 types of gender-responsive adaptive livelihood options. Adaptation actions at household level through CRF, who are most vulnerable and often left out from public goods benefits and widening the community scale adaptation micro-projects to reduce the vulnerability to climate change both followed the community risk assessment methodology. The vulnerable households and community within the Local Government (LG) constituencies interact in such a manner that ultimately ensure readiness to tackle climate hazards and strengthens the means for survival of the vulnerable community. However, such links require further strengthening and be informed from science-led predictions and scenarios of climate-induced risks. While, the project is well articulated in terms of participatory CRA, what will be more beneficial for climate change adaptation in this regard is a top-down method blended approach in promoting science-driven, informed participation of community in prioritizing their adaptation options at household and community levels. Potential for scaling-up of climate resilient/adaptive livelihoods: The core process of the selection of vulnerable households include (1) CRA and RRAP, (2) based on CRA, identification of two/three vulnerable wards from each UP, (3) conducting the census in these 147 wards, (4) identifying eligible beneficiaries (46,000) by minimum 0.5 vulnerability scores , (5) selection of relatively most vulnerable (26,000) households, with a primary shortlist (17000) and a waiting list (9000 HHs), (6) run a grievance register and redress mechanism and (7) finalize the 17000 HHs as final beneficiaries for the CRF. 98% of these HHs identified women member of the household as primary participant in the CRF and therefore, 16,660 are women as primary beneficiaries of CRF. These beneficiaries are pursuing 22 different types of climate resilient livelihoods in group enterprises, as a follow-up of the choices of the means of livelihoods and start-up grant support from the Project in two tranches. There are three (3) options to scale-up these livelihoods: (1) reaching to all eligible vulnerable groups (46,000 HHs) with different grants packages or reaching to all most vulnerable people (26,000 HHs) with common grant package; (2) scale-up of the most viable climate resilient livelihood options with formal credit market with higher environmental safeguard (i.e. crab fattening); and (3) facilitate private sector actors and co-design business case for scalable business opportunities on climate resilient means of livelihoods where vulnerable people secured income with backed-up skill training and social guarantee. A few examples include hydroponics, bio-flake, aquaponics, sunflower, crab-fattening, saline tolerant pulse, fruits and oil seeds production. Use of innovation for tracking and measuring adaptation: LoGIC demonstrates a comprehensive approach to ensure climate resilience. To keep records, track and measure adaptation, LoGIC has developed and put in place the state-of-the-art Accounting &amp;amp; Management Information Systems (MIS), Adaptation Tracking and Measuring (ATM) system for the project to make sure all the climate money are spent with rationale, the data are regularly entered and updated in the software which generates reports and tell stories of change in the field. Project&#x2019;s M&amp;amp;E system inculcates all the information from the software and the database to create reports. Tapping upon innovation towards maximizing results, project has successfully trained 72 Union Parishads (LGI) Secretary on Accounting &amp;amp; MIS software. Field level project staffs have been provided hands-on training on filed-level data entry in changing context, future risks, use of grants etc. in the app-Tab-based ATM software. This approach has started to evolve as a transparent and accountable tool to measure climate change and adaptation data on the ground. Sustainable Development Goals: Progressing towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has been pressing for more attention towards environmental issues. Of the 17 proposed SDGs, four (4) are related to climate change and environment and LoGIC contributes to or works towards Goals 1, 5, 10, 11, 13 and 16, i.e. contributing towards poverty eradiation, gender equality, sustainable communities, reduced inequalities, stronger institutions and climate change, broadly. LoGIC is working towards Goal 13.3, which is aimed to improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning through indicators (13.3.1 and 13.3.2). Likewise, with 13.2, i.e. to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. Although LoGIC has been working towards Goals 1, 5, 10, 11 and 16, only Goal 13 is included in the Strategic Results Framework. Specific achievements against goals are being studied and will be compiled for reporting. During the period, in early March 2020 a joint field visit was made to the project sites at Barguna district for five days. The joint mission was composed of EU, UNDP, UNCDF, GoB and Embassy of Sweden. Overall the findings were impressive. The third Project Steering Committee meeting took place virtually on 12 August 2020 chaired by the Senior Secretary, Local Government Division, Ministry of Local Government. Where relevant government ministry and departments participated. The meeting agreed and advocated for the top up and 2 years extension (up to 30 June 2023), expressed their commitment by agreeing to add 100 MBDT (about 1.2 MUSD) from GoB. Both EU and Embassy of Sweden participated in the meeting. Some major accomplishments 1. Community Risk Assessment (CRA) completed for 147 words in 72 Unions, 17,000 most vulnerable identified and listed in a through participatory manner. Among them 98% are female 2. Vulnerability identified for 147 words, 3. Climate resilient livelihood identified for 17,000 most vulnerable, transferred 1st tranche of Community Resilience Fund (CRF) through formal banking process.

The development intervention consists of a five-year project in the field of media development and human rights, which will be implemented by the FOJO Media Institute in cooperation with a local partner, the Management and Resources Development Initiative (MRDI). The project is called Improving Investigative Journalism, Bangladesh. Operations comprise a number of components that aim at capacity development of media organizations and individuals active in the media, networking, sectoral strengthening and special efforts in the field of media security.

Special thematic focus within the initiative lies in Sida&apos;s priority issues in good governance, human rights, labor law, gender equality, environment and climate.

It is Sida&apos;s opinion that the FOJO Media Institute has a unique position in Swedish development cooperation in the field of media development, has shown good results in previous projects of similar nature in other countries and has good prospects for achieving results also in this project in Bangladesh.

The initiative in question is fully in line with the Government&apos;s Development Cooperation Strategy with Bangladesh 2014-2020.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching development objective for the intervention is to: &quot;Contribute to improving the conditions for people to raise themselves out of poverty, strengthening democracy, respect for human rights and gender equality, and to contribute to sustainable development.&quot;
The specific objective of the intervention is stated as &#x201C;Media in Bangladesh contributes to strengthened democracy and gender equality, greater respect for human rights and freedom from oppression.&#x201D;To this Objective, Fojo links three outcomes &#x2013; two immediate and one intermediate.
1) The first immediate outcome is linked to the strengthening of individual media outlets and journalists in their production of qualitative journalism: &quot;Targeted media houses and news providers identify, research and produce high quality investigative journalism, particularly on gender equality, labour rights, corruption and environmental impact and climate change&quot;.
2) The second immediate outcome is focused on strengthening the media sector as a whole, to enable a conducive environment for this production: &quot;Targeted partners in the media sector collaborate to create a conducive environment for investigative journalism, particularly on gender equality, labour rights, corruption and environmental impact and climate change&quot;.
The theory of change links the outcomes to the overarching and the specific objective through the following logic: &quot;The stories published result in an invigorated debate on issues related to gender equality, labour rights, corruption and environmental impact and climate change as well as other issues vital for the development of democracy, gender equality and respect for human rights. The debate contributes to strengthened democracy and gender equality, greater respect for human rights and freedom from oppression. Strengthened democracy and gender equality, greater respect for human rights and freedom from oppression contributes to improving the conditions for people to raise themselves out of poverty in a better environment.&#x201D;</narrative>

The development intervention consists of a five-year project in the field of media development and human rights, which will be implemented by the FOJO Media Institute in cooperation with a local partner, the Management and Resources Development Initiative (MRDI). The project is called Improving Investigative Journalism, Bangladesh. Operations comprise a number of components that aim at capacity development of media organizations and individuals active in the media, networking, sectoral strengthening and special efforts in the field of media security.

Special thematic focus within the initiative lies in Sida&apos;s priority issues in good governance, human rights, labor law, gender equality, environment and climate.

It is Sida&apos;s opinion that the FOJO Media Institute has a unique position in Swedish development cooperation in the field of media development, has shown good results in previous projects of similar nature in other countries and has good prospects for achieving results also in this project in Bangladesh.

The initiative in question is fully in line with the Government&apos;s Development Cooperation Strategy with Bangladesh 2014-2020.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching development objective for the intervention is to: &quot;Contribute to improving the conditions for people to raise themselves out of poverty, strengthening democracy, respect for human rights and gender equality, and to contribute to sustainable development.&quot;
The specific objective of the intervention is stated as &#x201C;Media in Bangladesh contributes to strengthened democracy and gender equality, greater respect for human rights and freedom from oppression.&#x201D;To this Objective, Fojo links three outcomes &#x2013; two immediate and one intermediate.
1) The first immediate outcome is linked to the strengthening of individual media outlets and journalists in their production of qualitative journalism: &quot;Targeted media houses and news providers identify, research and produce high quality investigative journalism, particularly on gender equality, labour rights, corruption and environmental impact and climate change&quot;.
2) The second immediate outcome is focused on strengthening the media sector as a whole, to enable a conducive environment for this production: &quot;Targeted partners in the media sector collaborate to create a conducive environment for investigative journalism, particularly on gender equality, labour rights, corruption and environmental impact and climate change&quot;.
The theory of change links the outcomes to the overarching and the specific objective through the following logic: &quot;The stories published result in an invigorated debate on issues related to gender equality, labour rights, corruption and environmental impact and climate change as well as other issues vital for the development of democracy, gender equality and respect for human rights. The debate contributes to strengthened democracy and gender equality, greater respect for human rights and freedom from oppression. Strengthened democracy and gender equality, greater respect for human rights and freedom from oppression contributes to improving the conditions for people to raise themselves out of poverty in a better environment.&#x201D;</narrative>

Det f&#xF6;reslagna programmet var en forts&#xE4;ttning p&#xE5; det tidigare st&#xF6;det till MoWA och UNDP (avtalspart UNDP) och det gemensamma programmet &quot;Partnership for Gender Equality (PGE) III&quot; (insatsnummer 51100037), till vilket Sida gett ett st&#xF6;d om 8 000 000 SEK under perioden 2012-2015. 

I samband med insatsens beredning under v&#xE5;ren 2017, var avsikten att st&#xF6;det skulle kanaliseras till b&#xE5;de MoWa och UNDP med tv&#xE5; avtalspartners. UNDP skulle hantera 50 % av st&#xF6;det genom en s.k. National Implementation Modality (NIM), genom vilken MoWA skulle ansvara f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;rande under uppf&#xF6;ljning av UNDP, och en gradvis &#xF6;kning av direktfinansiering skulle ske till MoWA. I januari 2017 gav Sida st&#xF6;d till MoWA i form av en teknisk expertis, vars syfte var att bist&#xE5; parterna att utveckla former f&#xF6;r det nya programmet. Ambassaden h&#xF6;ll ett kommitt&#xE9;m&#xF6;te om insatsen den 1 juli 2017. En reviderad version av ans&#xF6;kan inkom ambassaden den 26 juli 2017.

I samband med det f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;rrade politiska l&#xE4;get under h&#xF6;sten 2017, med Kambodjas beslut om uppl&#xF6;sning av oppositionspartiet, har formerna f&#xF6;r samarbetet &#xE4;ndrats. Sida har kommit fram till f&#xF6;ljande h&#xE5;llning i f&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llande till statliga partners:

&quot;Till dess att den svenska regeringen eventuellt v&#xE4;ljer att ge Sida andra instruktioner, ing&#xE5;s inga nya insatsavtal inom utvecklingssamarbetet som inneb&#xE4;r att det kanaliseras finansiella resurser direkt till staten, med undantag f&#xF6;r st&#xF6;d till utbildning och forskning.&quot; 

Finansiellt st&#xF6;d till, och avtal med, j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhetsministeriet &#xE4;r d&#xE4;rmed inte l&#xE4;ngre aktuellt. Insatsen bed&#xF6;ms dock fortsatt vara relevant. Den 11 december 2017 inkom UNDP med projektf&#xF6;rslaget &quot;Project to Support the Leading the Way for Gender Equality Programme&quot;. Insatsen syftar till att st&#xE4;rka MoWA:s program: att st&#xE4;rka den offentliga sektorn genom att utforma och genomf&#xF6;ra j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhetspolicys, st&#xE4;rka samverkan kring j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet, fr&#xE4;mja en attitydf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring f&#xF6;r &#xF6;kad j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet hos allm&#xE4;nheten och unga kambodjaner, samt fr&#xE4;mja &#xF6;kat antal kvinnor i beslutsfattande positioner liksom ett st&#xE4;rkt kvinnligt ledarskap. I till&#xE4;gg har st&#xF6;d till civilsamh&#xE4;llet och dess roll inom j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhetsarbetet inkluderats. Avtalspartner &#xE4;r UNDP.

Genom NIM-finansiering, ansvarar j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhetsministeriet f&#xF6;r medelshantering och genomf&#xF6;r insatser. I till&#xE4;gg finansieras insats f&#xF6;r s&#xE4;rskilt utsatta grupper genomf&#xF6;rs i samverkan med utbildnings-, civil service- och informationsministerierna. Genom programmet erh&#xE5;ller j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhetsministeriet kapacitetsst&#xF6;d f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhetsinsatser. 

Insatsen kommer att p&#xE5;g&#xE5; under perioden 1 september 2017 till 31 december 2020 och uppg&#xE5;r till totalt ca 17,5 MSEK (2 048 629 USD), utav vilket Sida finansierar 9,5 MSEK. Resterande belopp finansieras av UNDP i form av en internationell teknisk r&#xE5;dgivare samt finansiering av enstaka insatser.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The programme aims to support Cambodia in effectively institutionalizing gender equality policies across  government, strengthen coordination on gender equality, promote changes in attitude in favor of enhanced equality amongst citizens and young Cambodians, and promote an increased number of women in decision making positions and  a strengthened feminist leadership. Besides support to the implementation of activities, MoWA will, through UNDP, receive support to strengthen its capacity to plan for, implement and follow up on gender equality interventions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att bek&#xE4;mpa covid-19
Insatsen School Improvement Fund (SIF) &#xE4;r en givar- och myndighetsgemensam fond f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rvaltningsmedel till skolor i Kambodja. Medel fr&#xE5;n fonden distribueras till alla offentliga skolor fr&#xE5;n f&#xF6;rskola till och med sekund&#xE4;rskolan. Denna fond ers&#xE4;tter den tidigare svenskfinansierade fonden School Improvement Grants (SIG) och den statliga School Operational Budget (SOB). 

Det kambodjanska finansministeriet, Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), &#xE4;r Sidas avtalspartner som representant f&#xF6;r den kambodjanska regeringen och mottagare av det svenska bidraget. De svenska medlen &#xF6;verf&#xF6;rs fr&#xE5;n MEF (fr&#xE5;n ett specifikt bankkonto f&#xF6;r Sidas bidrag) till det kambodjanska utbildningsministeriet, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS). F&#xF6;rmedling till skolorna av SIF-programmets medel sker genom banktransfereringar fr&#xE5;n MoEYS. Avtalet klarg&#xF6;r att MoEYS &#xE4;r ansvarigt ministerium f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;rande av programmet och Sidas huvudsakliga motpart i genomf&#xF6;randet. 

Framsteg har skett inom utbildningssektorn i Kambodja under det senaste &#xE5;rtiondet, s&#xE4;rskilt p&#xE5; l&#xE5;g- och mellanstadieniv&#xE5;. Ett antal system- och ledningsrelaterade svagheter kvarst&#xE5;r dock. Vidare &#xE4;r utbildningskvaliteten l&#xE5;g och alltf&#xF6;r f&#xE5; barn fullf&#xF6;ljer skolan bortom de f&#xF6;rsta sju skol&#xE5;ren. F&#xF6;r att bist&#xE5; i att hantera n&#xE5;gra av dessa utmaningar beslutade Sida i september 2013 att l&#xE4;mna st&#xF6;d till en utbyggnad av ett system f&#xF6;r flexibla skolbidrag genom SIG-programmet. 

En uttalad ambition f&#xF6;r insatsen var att de l&#xE4;rdomar som genererades inom SIG-programmet skulle p&#xE5;verka det existerande statliga transfereringssystemet f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rvaltningsbidrag till skolorna (SOB) genom att SIG och SOB skulle sl&#xE5;s samman inom ramen f&#xF6;r ett enhetligt, effektivt och flexibelt system f&#xF6;r &#xF6;verf&#xF6;ring och hantering av delegerade skolbidrag. Avsikten med Sidas st&#xF6;d till SIG var s&#xE5;ledes ocks&#xE5; att uppn&#xE5; en systemeffekt. F&#xF6;r att minska riskerna med en omfattande kontanthantering i flera led inom utbildningssystemet, st&#xE4;llde Sida som krav att bankkonton skulle &#xF6;ppnas f&#xF6;r skolorna f&#xF6;r att m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;ra direkttransfereringar fr&#xE5;n central niv&#xE5; till de enskilda skolorna. Hantering av formella finansiella fl&#xF6;den sker nu via banksystemet f&#xF6;r alla offentliga skolor.

Enligt den studie av offentliga finansiella fl&#xF6;den inom utbildningsystemet (Public Expenditure Tracking Survey &#x2013; PETS) som har genomf&#xF6;rts av V&#xE4;rldsbanken under 2017 har anv&#xE4;ndningen av banktransfereringar i sig lett till en stor f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring f&#xF6;r att minska felaktig anv&#xE4;ndning av medel. Den PETS som genomf&#xF6;rdes av V&#xE4;rldsbanken 2006 fann att endast 70 % av f&#xF6;rvaltningsbidragen kom fram till skolorna, PETS 2017 finner att 100 % av medlen nu kommer fram. PETS 2017, liksom andra rapporter, konstaterar vidare att den kvalitetsh&#xF6;jning som skett p&#xE5; lokal skolniv&#xE5; kan h&#xE4;rledas direkt fr&#xE5;n SIG systemet p&#xE5; grund av dess fokus p&#xE5; lokala behov och f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar. 

Det nya systemet f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rvaltningsbidrag till skolor, SIF, bygger p&#xE5; erfarenhet fr&#xE5;n s&#xE5;v&#xE4;l SOB som SIG. Den st&#xF6;rsta skillnaden mot SIG-programmet &#xE4;r att Kambodja och Sverige &#xE5;tar sig att gemensamt finansiera insatsen. SIG-programmet var inledningsvis endast finansierat av Sverige men p&#xE5; grund av v&#xE4;xelkursf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar och svenska kronans sjunkande v&#xE4;rde under genomf&#xF6;randetiden bidrog det kambodjanska finansministeriet med medel motsvarande underskottet i den planerade budgeten. Regler och instruktioner f&#xF6;r de lokala skolornas anv&#xE4;ndning och rapportering av medlen i SIF programmet &#xE4;r i stort sett samst&#xE4;mmiga med reglerna och instruktionerna f&#xF6;r SIG-programmet. 

Genom SIF kommer bidrag att n&#xE5; ut till samtliga ca 8 900 offentliga skolor fr&#xE5;n grundskola till gymnasium (fler &#xE4;n 11 000 enheter, n&#xE4;r de f&#xF6;rskolor som finns inom vissa prim&#xE4;rskolor r&#xE4;knas in). SIF:s f&#xF6;rvaltningsbidrag, i motsats till det tidigare SOB systemet, inneb&#xE4;r att skolorna har l&#xE5;ngtg&#xE5;ende befogenheter att best&#xE4;mma &#xF6;ver hur delegerade medel ska anv&#xE4;ndas. Anv&#xE4;ndningen av SIF-medlen regleras i en instruktion fastst&#xE4;lld av MoEYS; i huvudsak f&#xE5;r medlen anv&#xE4;ndas f&#xF6;r &#xF6;kad undervisningskvalit&#xE9;et, mindre underh&#xE5;ll av lokaler samt st&#xF6;d till svaga elever. H&#xE4;rigenom &#xF6;kar m&#xF6;jligheterna att tillfredsst&#xE4;lla de faktiska behov som finns i skolorna, vilket i sin tur p&#xE5; sikt f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad utbildningskvalitet och minskade avhopp.

P&#xE5; grund av den negativa politiska utvecklingen i Kambodja under 2017 har Sida beslutat att tills vidare inte ing&#xE5; nya insatsavtal inom utvecklingssamarbetet som inneb&#xE4;r att det kanaliseras finansiella resurser direkt till staten, med undantag f&#xF6;r st&#xF6;d till utbildning och forskning. Fortsatt st&#xF6;d till decentraliseringsreformen kommer d&#xE4;rmed inte att utg&#xE5;. &#xD6;kad kunskap och h&#xF6;jd utbildningsniv&#xE5; bed&#xF6;ms l&#xE5;ngsiktigt vara f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttning f&#xF6;r ett h&#xE5;llbart demokratiskt samh&#xE4;lle i Kambodja. De senaste decenniernas stora framsteg f&#xF6;r &#xF6;kad tillg&#xE5;ng till grundutbildning och en l&#xE5;ngsam kvalitetsh&#xF6;jning inom utbildningsystemet, samt den kraftiga &#xF6;kningen av antalet studerande p&#xE5; h&#xF6;gskoleniv&#xE5; bed&#xF6;ms ha bidragit till den snabba ekonomiska utvecklingen som landet &#xE5;tnjuter och de &#xF6;kade kraven som framst&#xE4;lls p&#xE5; medborgarinflytande och yttrandefrihet. Fortsatt och l&#xE5;ngsiktigt st&#xF6;d till utbildning och forskning bed&#xF6;ms vara ett viktigt bidrag till en l&#xE5;ngsiktig demokratisk utveckling.  

Mot bakgrund av ovanst&#xE5;ende f&#xF6;resl&#xE5;s att Sida l&#xE4;mnar st&#xF6;d till insatsen School Improvement Fund f&#xF6;r &#xE5;ren 2018-2021, med ett totalbelopp om 186 500 000 kronor. Av medlen kommer Sida att beh&#xE5;lla 6 500 000 kronor f&#xF6;r uppf&#xF6;ljningskomponenten medan resterande 180 000 000 kronor utbetalas direkt till det kambodjanska finansministeriet (MEF).</narrative>

In order to achieve this objective SIDA will support the co-financing of the SIF between 2018 and 2021. This co-financing will incrementally decrease each year in order to assist Royal Government of Cambodia in incrementally graduating towards full financing of the SIF by 2022.
In addition, SIDA will provide complementary funding to assist the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) in conducting evidence-based impact monitoring, technical reviews and programme evaluation. Broader capacity building support to the establishment of the new SIF will be provided through the MoEYS Capacity Development Partnership Fund (CDPF).
The expected outcome objectives of the interevention are:
(1) expanded access to education services at pre-school, primary and secondary levels;
(2) improved completion rates for primary, lower and upper secondary levels; and
(3) improved capacity for school management.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has changed the name of SIF to School Operational Fund (SOB) although the agreement on Swedish support continues to use the SIF. The second year of the Sida support to the SOF/SIF had a better start than the first year as all the Swedish funds were disbursed to the schools as planned early in the year, in late January or early February. The first tranche of the two annual disbursements of the Government funds was disbursed together with the Swedish funds. The merge of the two parallel funding structures, the external development partner funding (in this case mainly Swedish funds) and the funds coming from the Government&#x2019;s budget into a single funding stream was not fully however implemented but is expected to be fully implemented from 2020. The gradual decrease of the Swedish funding and the&#xA0;corresponding increased of Government funding has taken place as planned. During different field visits conducted by Embassy staff to schools around the country, teachers, principals and members of the School Support Committees expressed that they had received funds more or less on time and the full amount. The use of the banking system for transfers of funds to schools that was introduced with the SIG (the earlier Swedish funded support to schools) has had a huge effect on increased transparency and accountability over fund flows and the use of funds at school level. That informal &#x201C;leaks&#x201D; of funds from the central funding instances to the local level have stopped has had an strong anti-corruption effect. &#xA0;This impression is also supported by findings reported in different reports on other aspects of education development by different organisations such as NEP, World Bank, ADB, UNICEF and UNESCO. The reports from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) show that the absolute biggest part of the funds have been utilised to buy additional learning material, paper, pens, simple laboratory equipment and also books for the school libraries. Around 70 % of the SIF funds were used for this purpose. &#xA0;The second largest part, 15 %, was for providing extra lessons to slow learners, approximately 10 % were used for minor reparations and ca. 5 % for administrative purposes. The reporting from MoEYS is based on an aggregated reporting line, from schools to districts, from districts to province, and from province to the central level. It is therefore difficult to analyse if there are any major differences between different district or schools. At province level there does not seem to be any significant difference on the use of the funds. The progress in relation to the expected outcomes in the framework&#xA0; has mainly been somewhat positive with a few setbacks. At primary level the completion rate reached 88.2 % which is higher that the target rate of 82.1 %. However, the indicators on admission, dropout and repetitions did not meet the target. The explanations given by MoEYS is a) that schools have improved student assessments by conducting stricter summative tests of students leading to a higher percentage of failure on test, leading to drop-out and especially increased repetitions; b) schools still have limited resources available, including financial and personnel to support students at risk. The drop-out rate in lower secondary education in the academic year 2018-2019 increased by 2.8 % from previous academic year, from 15.8 % to 18.6 %. Particularly boys tend to drop-out at this level. MoEYS describes the reason to this is: &#x201C;The perennial economic problem of families especially in the rural areas, which prompted teenage students to seek jobs to be able to help the financial needs of the family, is always a factor affecting the drop-out rate.&#x201D; UNICEF, CDPF and others have conducted research on the issue and the poverty is seen as the major factor behind the drop-out. Addressing this is however to a large degree outside of the what can be addressed within the education system. One of the options is increased scholarships, around 100&#xA0;000 poor students received Government scholarships in the academic year 2018-2019.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The programme, supported jointly by Sweden and Finland, is ultimately intended to benefit the marginalized women and men in rural Kenya through improved and equitable access to water and sanitation - e.g. by means of constructing new boreholes, rehabilitation of non-functional pumps, and constructing sanitation facilities in schools - and improved water resources management - e.g. by means of constructing sand dams for water storage or strengthened enforcement of regulations. In light of the changing Kenyan context of devolved responsibility for delivering water and sanitation services, to achieve this goal it is necessary for Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) to adopt a new approach based on cooperation with and support to new partners at the county level. Moreover, in order to draw lessons from previous WSTF rural water projects there is need to revise the project cycles for water and sanitation (CPC) and for water resource management (WDC), which constitute the two main work methods of WSTF work at the local level. The key differences compared with previous set-up are: county-level as point of departure, projects concentrated to six counties, partnership with the county governments, projects are based on local needs and planning at the county level, clusters of projects, water companies as implementing partners in each county, the management of water resources is more closely linked to water supply projects, the control of the forwarding of funds is strengthened, capacity development is based on assessments of partners&apos; capacities and sustainable management models will be explored, including public-private partnerships. The changes are designed to increase efficiency, sustainability, poverty focus and the control of the forwarded funds. The poverty focus will be strengthened and institutionalized through the county governments increasing their skills and capabilities for &apos;pro-poor&apos; planning and budgeting in water and sanitation. WSTF&apos;s internal capacity and efficiency will also be strengthened as part of the intervention. The programme involves a considerable change of WSTFs working methods and it is envisaged that WSTF will be able to extend the programme to other counties. It is important to emphasize that the programme contains many uncertainties given that several important cornerstones of the programme are not yet completed, such as, the results framework.The first year will thus be crucial to ensure that all the systems and structures are in place and milestones have been agreed to provide guidance on this process and clarify what activities must be completed by the end of the first year. In addition to the agreement conditions, a number of measures, such as Sweden contracting an independent monitoring consultant and a strong TA component being incorporated into the programme, have therefore been taken to ensure that the first-year operations will build a solid basis for the programme. Such measures are foreseen to ensure that the programme delivers the expected results. (The consultant will entail a separate contribution and decision given that the Trac-system does not allow for components.)</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Results as at 30 June 2017 Outcome 1: Enhanced county capacity: - Water Utility Mapping was carried out for 5 counties with a view to supporting the Water Utilities to analyse water Points, coverage and schemes in their service areas for future planning. - Capacity building of the Water Utilities (implementing partners of the actual projects) on procurement, financial management, etc. Such training was done by the County Resident Monitors and/or the contracted Service Agents. - There were also county exchange visits carried out for peer learning purposes. - A number of activities under this outcome were pushed to 2017/18, like the development of a reporting framework for the counties, development of holistic county water master plans and strategies. Outcome 2: Improved Management of Water Resources: - The continued implementation of 10 Water Resources Users Associations (WRUAs) projects (started late 2015/2016) were supported to undertake catchment protection activities such as erosion control through gabions, pegging of riparian land and tree planting. - To deliver on the target of supporting WRUAs to become sustainable, an analysis was carried out of WRUA management support in business planning. - The WRUAs operating across more than one county &#x2013; so called &#x2018;transboundary WRUAs&#x2019; could not be primarily not be funded as there was no MoU with the up-stream or downstream counties. E.g. in one case the investment had to be made for a water source which was located in an adjacent county to the J6P-county. Therefore work was undertaken to reach an agreement between the bordering counties and a strategy and a mechanism for funding the transboundary WRUAs was developed. This approach and strategy with MoUs between the bordering counties is foreseen to become a model for addressing transboundary WRM issues across Kenya. Outcome 3: Water Supply - 31 water supply projects were approved for funding during the period and subsequent procurement and implementation were supported. In many cases the projects were extensions of already existing schemes, additional distributions lines, tanks, etc., to increase access and number of connections or they involved metering to improve the collection of revenue as well as making more water available for customers downstream. 3 projects in Narok were discontinued, i.e., the WSTF did not fund these investments as they had not received a noobjection on the procurement process from WSTF before awarding contracts and initiating the works. - At the close of the reporting period no projects had been finalized. This delay is of concern as it has taken more than 1 year to have the projects completed. Some factors driving this delay are low capacity of the water utilities in procurement, workmanship has been poor in some instances, requiring corrections and adjustments, WSTF has not always been responsive to no-objections, etc. - Capacity development support to the water utilities in service delivery models for the water supply Projects has not yet started. - Rural Water Utilities Technical Package/Tool Kit and Brochures in support of the water utilities were produced. Outcome 4: Sanitation - This outcome area is also delayed and 22 projects on institutional sanitation were awaiting finalization as the reporting period ended. Procurement and implementation for the same projects were supported during the reporting period. There have been challenges in spreading the investments too thinly, constructing only one sanitation block per school instead of focusing on fewer schools and meeting all their needs. - Community-led total sanitation: training on CLTS triggering for the public health officers and CRMs was carried out in all counties and the GESI guidelines were used to target the poorest communities for CLTS. Here the challenges has in part been that the funds for sanitation is channeled through the Water Utilities - WSTF developed GESI-responsive designs for institutional sanitation that were circulate to Water Utilities and are in use during construction. Outcome 5: WSTF capacity strengthened - Additional tools were developed, such as the &apos;Design-Cost Protocols&apos; to support the designs of the water supply and sanitation projects. - Annual operations monitoring of the urban, rural and results-based investments was carried out to follow up on projects&#x2019; functionality and sustainability and take appropriate actions. - The County Resident Monitors (CRMs) were supported by trainings, payments and logistical issues. - The Kenya Water Week was held back to back with the Annual Water Sector Review in November 2016 attracting many different stakeholders and providing an important platform for sharing knowledge and experiences. The county level was well-represented. Furthermore, Water Innovation awards were given out to entrepreneurs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att bek&#xE4;mpa covid-19
Programmet, som &#xE4;r samfinansierat av Sverige och Finland, syftar ytterst till att gagna marginaliserade kvinnor och m&#xE4;n p&#xE5; landsbygden i Kenya genom &#xF6;kad och r&#xE4;ttvis tillg&#xE5;ng till vatten och sanitet, exempelvis genom konstruktion av nya borrh&#xE5;l, rehabilitering av icke-fungerande pumpar, och sanitetsl&#xF6;sningar i skolor - och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad f&#xF6;rvaltning av vattenresurser - exempelvis genom konstruktion av sanddammar f&#xF6;r vattenlagring och st&#xE4;rkt efterlevnad av lagstiftning. Mot bakgrund av den f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndrade kenyanska kontexten med decentraliserat ansvar f&#xF6;r att leverera vatten- och sanitetstj&#xE4;nster &#xE4;r det n&#xF6;dv&#xE4;ndigt f&#xF6;r samarbetpartnern Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) att arbeta utifr&#xE5;n en ny ansats som bygger p&#xE5; samarbete med och st&#xF6;d till nya akt&#xF6;rer p&#xE5; l&#xE4;nsregeringsniv&#xE5; (county) f&#xF6;r att n&#xE5; m&#xE5;let.

Dessa &#xE5;tg&#xE4;rder sammantagna v&#xE4;ntas leda till att programmet kan leverera f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntade resultat.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The programme, supported jointly by Sweden and Finland, is ultimately intended to benefit the marginalized women and men in rural Kenya through improved and equitable access to water and sanitation - e.g. by means of constructing new boreholes, rehabilitation of non-functional pumps, and constructing sanitation facilities in schools - and improved water resources management - e.g. by means of constructing sand dams for water storage or strengthened enforcement of regulations. In light of the changing Kenyan context of devolved responsibility for delivering water and sanitation services, to achieve this goal it is necessary for Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) to adopt a new approach based on cooperation with and support to new partners at the county level. Moreover, in order to draw lessons from previous WSTF rural water projects there is need to revise the project cycles for water and sanitation (CPC) and for water resource management (WDC), which constitute the two main work methods of WSTF work at the local level. The key differences compared with previous set-up are: county-level as point of departure, projects concentrated to six counties, partnership with the county governments, projects are based on local needs and planning at the county level, clusters of projects, water companies as implementing partners in each county, the management of water resources is more closely linked to water supply projects, the control of the forwarding of funds is strengthened, capacity development is based on assessments of partners&apos; capacities and sustainable management models will be explored, including public-private partnerships. The changes are designed to increase efficiency, sustainability, poverty focus and the control of the forwarded funds. The poverty focus will be strengthened and institutionalized through the county governments increasing their skills and capabilities for &apos;pro-poor&apos; planning and budgeting in water and sanitation. WSTF&apos;s internal capacity and efficiency will also be strengthened as part of the intervention. The programme involves a considerable change of WSTFs working methods and it is envisaged that WSTF will be able to extend the programme to other counties. It is important to emphasize that the programme contains many uncertainties given that several important cornerstones of the programme are not yet completed, such as, the results framework.The first year will thus be crucial to ensure that all the systems and structures are in place and milestones have been agreed to provide guidance on this process and clarify what activities must be completed by the end of the first year. In addition to the agreement conditions, a number of measures, such as Sweden contracting an independent monitoring consultant and a strong TA component being incorporated into the programme, have therefore been taken to ensure that the first-year operations will build a solid basis for the programme. Such measures are foreseen to ensure that the programme delivers the expected results. (The consultant will entail a separate contribution and decision given that the Trac-system does not allow for components.)</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Results as at 30 June 2017 Outcome 1: Enhanced county capacity: - Water Utility Mapping was carried out for 5 counties with a view to supporting the Water Utilities to analyse water Points, coverage and schemes in their service areas for future planning. - Capacity building of the Water Utilities (implementing partners of the actual projects) on procurement, financial management, etc. Such training was done by the County Resident Monitors and/or the contracted Service Agents. - There were also county exchange visits carried out for peer learning purposes. - A number of activities under this outcome were pushed to 2017/18, like the development of a reporting framework for the counties, development of holistic county water master plans and strategies. Outcome 2: Improved Management of Water Resources: - The continued implementation of 10 Water Resources Users Associations (WRUAs) projects (started late 2015/2016) were supported to undertake catchment protection activities such as erosion control through gabions, pegging of riparian land and tree planting. - To deliver on the target of supporting WRUAs to become sustainable, an analysis was carried out of WRUA management support in business planning. - The WRUAs operating across more than one county &#x2013; so called &#x2018;transboundary WRUAs&#x2019; could not be primarily not be funded as there was no MoU with the up-stream or downstream counties. E.g. in one case the investment had to be made for a water source which was located in an adjacent county to the J6P-county. Therefore work was undertaken to reach an agreement between the bordering counties and a strategy and a mechanism for funding the transboundary WRUAs was developed. This approach and strategy with MoUs between the bordering counties is foreseen to become a model for addressing transboundary WRM issues across Kenya. Outcome 3: Water Supply - 31 water supply projects were approved for funding during the period and subsequent procurement and implementation were supported. In many cases the projects were extensions of already existing schemes, additional distributions lines, tanks, etc., to increase access and number of connections or they involved metering to improve the collection of revenue as well as making more water available for customers downstream. 3 projects in Narok were discontinued, i.e., the WSTF did not fund these investments as they had not received a noobjection on the procurement process from WSTF before awarding contracts and initiating the works. - At the close of the reporting period no projects had been finalized. This delay is of concern as it has taken more than 1 year to have the projects completed. Some factors driving this delay are low capacity of the water utilities in procurement, workmanship has been poor in some instances, requiring corrections and adjustments, WSTF has not always been responsive to no-objections, etc. - Capacity development support to the water utilities in service delivery models for the water supply Projects has not yet started. - Rural Water Utilities Technical Package/Tool Kit and Brochures in support of the water utilities were produced. Outcome 4: Sanitation - This outcome area is also delayed and 22 projects on institutional sanitation were awaiting finalization as the reporting period ended. Procurement and implementation for the same projects were supported during the reporting period. There have been challenges in spreading the investments too thinly, constructing only one sanitation block per school instead of focusing on fewer schools and meeting all their needs. - Community-led total sanitation: training on CLTS triggering for the public health officers and CRMs was carried out in all counties and the GESI guidelines were used to target the poorest communities for CLTS. Here the challenges has in part been that the funds for sanitation is channeled through the Water Utilities - WSTF developed GESI-responsive designs for institutional sanitation that were circulate to Water Utilities and are in use during construction. Outcome 5: WSTF capacity strengthened - Additional tools were developed, such as the &apos;Design-Cost Protocols&apos; to support the designs of the water supply and sanitation projects. - Annual operations monitoring of the urban, rural and results-based investments was carried out to follow up on projects&#x2019; functionality and sustainability and take appropriate actions. - The County Resident Monitors (CRMs) were supported by trainings, payments and logistical issues. - The Kenya Water Week was held back to back with the Annual Water Sector Review in November 2016 attracting many different stakeholders and providing an important platform for sharing knowledge and experiences. The county level was well-represented. Furthermore, Water Innovation awards were given out to entrepreneurs.</narrative>

This is a Public Private Development Partnership which is the result of collaboration between the Kenyan Dairy Processor NKCC, TetraLaval, Producer Organizations, Heifer International and Sida. The intervention&apos;s overarching objective is to contribute to an inclusive economic growth and reduce poverty in Kenya by developing a dairy supply chain that benefits smallholder dairy farmers in 5 counties in Kenya. The intervention builds the capacity of smallholder dairy farmers to significantly increase production and links them to a formal stable market. Consequently, the intervention objectives are to increase productivity, increase milk collection, improve milk quality, increase farmer incomes, increase the involvement of women and youth in milk production and last but not least increase the use of environmentally friendly dairy production practices. This is expected to improve incomes for 30 000 poor dairy smallholder farmers whereby 15000 are women.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Key among the activities targeted to achieve the above objectives were farmer mobilizations, establishment of management systems at county and producer organizations (POs) level as well as establishment of sustainable extensions systems. Building the capacitites of POs, farmers and the extension service providers was a priority, with all the mobilised 17,517 farmers being trained through the established extension structures. POs mobilisation and sentization entailed introducing Dairy Farm assistants (DFAs) to officers of county governments, Agricultural Sector Support Program (ASDSP) and POs. Farmers were sentised on the project based on the milk routes per the 24 POs and a total of 656 farmers (457 male and 199 Female) were reached. 26th February 2019- field visit to Embu attended by all the partners in the project was a display of close collaboration between the POs, NKCC and great coordination with the ASDSP existing structures. It also unearthed some of the challenges with regard to milk purchase price/payment by NKCC to the POs and the joint deliberation instruments put in place to solve these issues was impressive. Talks to revert ownership of NKCC or allow gradual ownership by farmers into NKCC to enable them recoup their investments and earn better incomes and profits were at the onset and this has been reinforced by the Governments drastic steps to reorganise, restructure and revamp NKCC factories around the country. The farmers we met during the field visit who are organised under dairy management groups also called dairy interest groups who form the local cooperatives, cited increase in their milk collection and membership respectively, since they started their partnership with KEMDAP. The team was impressed with their work. They have plans to invest more in the business and the project will link them to Impact Ventures to seek for funds. They would like to establish a feed milling plant, expand their milk processing and also venture in milk transportation business through involvement of the youth. Availability of quality feeds throughout the year for consistent milk production was still noted as a challenge</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
Kenyas regering (GoK) har bett Sverige att bidra till genomf&#xF6;randet av landets s.k. Vision 2030, den nya jordbrukspolicyn samt s.k. Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS 2010 &#x2013; 2020) genom fortsatt finansiering till jordbrukssektorn via ASDSP programmet (Agricultural Sector Development Support Programme, fas II) under aktivitetsperioden 2017-2022 och r&#xE4;kenskaps&#xE5;ret juli 2017 till juni 2022.  Kenyas egen finansiering till programmet uppg&#xE5;r till 2 092 500 000 KES, varav KES 1 292 500 000 kommer fr&#xE5;n landets 47 regionstyrelser och KES 800 000 000 fr&#xE5;n landets regering. Sverige har tillfr&#xE5;gats om att st&#xF6;dja programmet genom att tillhandah&#xE5;lla ekonomisk och teknisk hj&#xE4;lp motsvarande SEK 352 126 500, vilket &#xE4;ven inkluderar EU-delegerade bidrag p&#xE5; SEK 52 126 500. EU-delegering baseras p&#xE5; positiva erfarenheter fr&#xE5;n samarbetet mellan EU, Sverige och Tyskland under fas 1 av programmet mellan 2014 och 2016. EU-&#xF6;verenskommelsen har gjorts i enlighet med det s.k. Action Document som g&#xE4;ller &quot;st&#xF6;d till jordbrukssektorns transformeringsprocess samt en decentraliserad markf&#xF6;rvaltning&quot;. Detta godk&#xE4;ndes av Europakommissionen 2015 (KE/FED/037-776) och finansierades genom  EU-Kenya Cooperation 11th European Development Fund National Indicative Programme f&#xF6;r perioden 2014-2020. Grunden till avtalet mellan Sverige och EU var handlingsplanen &quot;transformation av jordbrukssektorn i Kenya&quot;, som utformades i december 2016. Planen syftar till att utveckla strukturer och kapaciteten f&#xF6;r en bredare sektor&#xF6;verskridande r&#xE5;dgivning och koordination p&#xE5; nationell, mellanstatlig och regional niv&#xE5; i syfte att st&#xE4;rka de policies och institutioner som p&#xE5;verkar v&#xE4;rdekedjornas utveckling. Resultaten f&#xF6;r EU-delegeringen &#xE4;r prim&#xE4;rt sammankopplade med  ASDSP II Outcome 4. EU-bidragen &#xE4;r emellertid inte &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta utan kommer att f&#xF6;ljas upp och rapporteras tillsammans med &#xF6;vriga medel. 

Det f&#xF6;reslagna programmet &#xE4;r en forts&#xE4;ttning (fas II) av ett liknande program (ASDSP I) som avslutades i juni 2017 och som st&#xF6;tts och samfinansierats av Sida och Kenyas regering (huvudsakligen genom landets regering) under perioden 2012 &#x2013; 2017. Enligt den interna slututv&#xE4;rderingen har programmet uppn&#xE5;tt goda resultat, bland annat f&#xF6;ljande: etablerande av strukturer och institutioner som beh&#xF6;vs f&#xF6;r utvecklingen av tre prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor per region; introduktion och st&#xE4;rkande av kapacitet f&#xF6;r att kunna utveckla v&#xE4;rdekedjor p&#xE5; nya s&#xE4;tt d&#xE4;r den privata sektorn och andra intressenter (huvudsakligen den privata sektorn) involveras, det har &#xE4;ven genomf&#xF6;rts andra v&#xE4;rdekedjeinitiativ; man har n&#xE5;tt ut till 563.347 v&#xE4;rdekejdeakt&#xF6;rer (46 % manliga, 36 % kvinnliga och 18 % ungdomar); &#xF6;kade inkomster (78 % f&#xF6;r manliga f&#xF6;retagare eller hush&#xE5;ll,  25 % f&#xF6;r kvinnliga hush&#xE5;ll och 15 % f&#xF6;r ungdomshush&#xE5;ll); &#xF6;kad livsmedelss&#xE4;kerhet fr&#xE5;n 61 %, 58 % respektive 61 % fr&#xE5;n utg&#xE5;ngsl&#xE4;get 32,8 %, 38 % respektive  42 % under 2016 f&#xF6;r manliga, kvinnliga respektive ungdomshush&#xE5;ll; &#xF6;kad produktivitet i prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor som mejerin&#xE4;ring och bananodling. Utv&#xE4;rderingen p&#xE5;visar &#xE4;ven v&#xE4;rdet av utvecklingsakt&#xF6;rer och regering att fungera som facilitatorer. 

Syftet med ASDSP II &#xE4;r att st&#xF6;dja omst&#xE4;llningen av jordbruks-, boskaps- och fiskeproduktion till kommersiellt orienterade f&#xF6;retag f&#xF6;r s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;llande av en h&#xE5;llbar livsmedels- och matf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning. Syftet &#xE4;r att utveckla prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor (VC) f&#xF6;r syssels&#xE4;ttning, &#xF6;kade inkomster och och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad livsmedels- och matf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjningen. Detta ska ske genom att man sammanf&#xF6;r de olika v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rerna (VCA) s&#xE5; att utvecklingshinder kan &#xF6;verbryggas och v&#xE4;rdekedjorna utvecklas p&#xE5; ett r&#xE4;ttvist och h&#xE5;llbart s&#xE4;tt. ASDSP II &#xE4;r f&#xF6;rankrat genom den nya jordbrukspolitiken (Agriculture Policy, AP) och bygger p&#xE5; resultaten fr&#xE5;n ASDSP I samt det man l&#xE4;rt fr&#xE5;n andra program inom denna sektor. Insatsen riktar sig till alla VCA:er, fr&#xE5;n prim&#xE4;ra producenter till konsumenter genom st&#xF6;d till aktiviteter fokuserade p&#xE5; de fyra st&#xF6;rsta utvecklingshindren: 1. L&#xE5;g produktivitet l&#xE4;ngs med hela v&#xE4;rdekedjan; 2. Otillr&#xE4;ckliga entrepren&#xF6;rskunskaper bland akt&#xF6;rer i hela v&#xE4;rdekedjan inklusive tj&#xE4;nsteleverant&#xF6;rer; 3. D&#xE5;lig marknadstillg&#xE5;ng f&#xF6;r v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rerna; och 4. Svaga och inadekvata strukturer och kapacitet f&#xF6;r r&#xE5;dgivning och koordination inom sektorn.

Insatsen f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till till fyra &#xF6;vergripande resultat: 1) &#xD6;kad produktivitet f&#xF6;r prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor; 2) St&#xE4;rkt entrepren&#xF6;rskap hos v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rer (VCA); 3) F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad marknadstillg&#xE5;ng f&#xF6;r prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekejdeakt&#xF6;rer; och 4. St&#xE4;rkta strukturer och kapacitet f&#xF6;r r&#xE5;dgivning och samarbete inom sektorn, speciellt inom den decentraliserade strukturen. Insatsen bed&#xF6;ms vara en f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttning f&#xF6;r landsbygdens strukturomvandling eftersom den f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till en kommersialisering av det sm&#xE5;skaliga jordbruket.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The overall goal of ASDSP II is &quot;to support transformation of crop, livestock and fisheries production into commercially oriented Enterprises that ensure sustainable food and nutrition security. The programme has a purpose &quot;to develop sustainable priority value chains for improved income, employment, food and nutrition security&quot;. To attain this purpose, the programme will aim to address three main problems: Low value chain productivity; inadequate entrepreneurial skills of value chain actors; low access to markets by value chain actors; and weak and inadequate structures and capacaties for consultation, cooperation, and coordination within the sector. 

The proposed intervention is a five year programme commencing activities in September 2017 and has specific objectives linked to addressing four key agricultural value chain problems as: 1. Improved productivity of priority value chains; 2. Entepreneurial skills of priority value chain actors strengthened; 3. Access to markets by priority value chains actors improved; and 4. Structures and capacities for consultation and, collaboration, cooperation and coordination in the sector strengthened.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
Kenyas regering (GoK) har bett Sverige att bidra till genomf&#xF6;randet av landets s.k. Vision 2030, den nya jordbrukspolicyn samt s.k. Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS 2010 &#x2013; 2020) genom fortsatt finansiering till jordbrukssektorn via ASDSP programmet (Agricultural Sector Development Support Programme, fas II) under aktivitetsperioden 2017-2022 och r&#xE4;kenskaps&#xE5;ret juli 2017 till juni 2022.  Kenyas egen finansiering till programmet uppg&#xE5;r till 2 092 500 000 KES, varav KES 1 292 500 000 kommer fr&#xE5;n landets 47 regionstyrelser och KES 800 000 000 fr&#xE5;n landets regering. Sverige har tillfr&#xE5;gats om att st&#xF6;dja programmet genom att tillhandah&#xE5;lla ekonomisk och teknisk hj&#xE4;lp motsvarande SEK 352 126 500, vilket &#xE4;ven inkluderar EU-delegerade bidrag p&#xE5; SEK 52 126 500. EU-delegering baseras p&#xE5; positiva erfarenheter fr&#xE5;n samarbetet mellan EU, Sverige och Tyskland under fas 1 av programmet mellan 2014 och 2016. EU-&#xF6;verenskommelsen har gjorts i enlighet med det s.k. Action Document som g&#xE4;ller &quot;st&#xF6;d till jordbrukssektorns transformeringsprocess samt en decentraliserad markf&#xF6;rvaltning&quot;. Detta godk&#xE4;ndes av Europakommissionen 2015 (KE/FED/037-776) och finansierades genom  EU-Kenya Cooperation 11th European Development Fund National Indicative Programme f&#xF6;r perioden 2014-2020. Grunden till avtalet mellan Sverige och EU var handlingsplanen &quot;transformation av jordbrukssektorn i Kenya&quot;, som utformades i december 2016. Planen syftar till att utveckla strukturer och kapaciteten f&#xF6;r en bredare sektor&#xF6;verskridande r&#xE5;dgivning och koordination p&#xE5; nationell, mellanstatlig och regional niv&#xE5; i syfte att st&#xE4;rka de policies och institutioner som p&#xE5;verkar v&#xE4;rdekedjornas utveckling. Resultaten f&#xF6;r EU-delegeringen &#xE4;r prim&#xE4;rt sammankopplade med  ASDSP II Outcome 4. EU-bidragen &#xE4;r emellertid inte &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta utan kommer att f&#xF6;ljas upp och rapporteras tillsammans med &#xF6;vriga medel. 

Det f&#xF6;reslagna programmet &#xE4;r en forts&#xE4;ttning (fas II) av ett liknande program (ASDSP I) som avslutades i juni 2017 och som st&#xF6;tts och samfinansierats av Sida och Kenyas regering (huvudsakligen genom landets regering) under perioden 2012 &#x2013; 2017. Enligt den interna slututv&#xE4;rderingen har programmet uppn&#xE5;tt goda resultat, bland annat f&#xF6;ljande: etablerande av strukturer och institutioner som beh&#xF6;vs f&#xF6;r utvecklingen av tre prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor per region; introduktion och st&#xE4;rkande av kapacitet f&#xF6;r att kunna utveckla v&#xE4;rdekedjor p&#xE5; nya s&#xE4;tt d&#xE4;r den privata sektorn och andra intressenter (huvudsakligen den privata sektorn) involveras, det har &#xE4;ven genomf&#xF6;rts andra v&#xE4;rdekedjeinitiativ; man har n&#xE5;tt ut till 563.347 v&#xE4;rdekejdeakt&#xF6;rer (46 % manliga, 36 % kvinnliga och 18 % ungdomar); &#xF6;kade inkomster (78 % f&#xF6;r manliga f&#xF6;retagare eller hush&#xE5;ll,  25 % f&#xF6;r kvinnliga hush&#xE5;ll och 15 % f&#xF6;r ungdomshush&#xE5;ll); &#xF6;kad livsmedelss&#xE4;kerhet fr&#xE5;n 61 %, 58 % respektive 61 % fr&#xE5;n utg&#xE5;ngsl&#xE4;get 32,8 %, 38 % respektive  42 % under 2016 f&#xF6;r manliga, kvinnliga respektive ungdomshush&#xE5;ll; &#xF6;kad produktivitet i prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor som mejerin&#xE4;ring och bananodling. Utv&#xE4;rderingen p&#xE5;visar &#xE4;ven v&#xE4;rdet av utvecklingsakt&#xF6;rer och regering att fungera som facilitatorer. 

Syftet med ASDSP II &#xE4;r att st&#xF6;dja omst&#xE4;llningen av jordbruks-, boskaps- och fiskeproduktion till kommersiellt orienterade f&#xF6;retag f&#xF6;r s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;llande av en h&#xE5;llbar livsmedels- och matf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning. Syftet &#xE4;r att utveckla prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor (VC) f&#xF6;r syssels&#xE4;ttning, &#xF6;kade inkomster och och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad livsmedels- och matf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjningen. Detta ska ske genom att man sammanf&#xF6;r de olika v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rerna (VCA) s&#xE5; att utvecklingshinder kan &#xF6;verbryggas och v&#xE4;rdekedjorna utvecklas p&#xE5; ett r&#xE4;ttvist och h&#xE5;llbart s&#xE4;tt. ASDSP II &#xE4;r f&#xF6;rankrat genom den nya jordbrukspolitiken (Agriculture Policy, AP) och bygger p&#xE5; resultaten fr&#xE5;n ASDSP I samt det man l&#xE4;rt fr&#xE5;n andra program inom denna sektor. Insatsen riktar sig till alla VCA:er, fr&#xE5;n prim&#xE4;ra producenter till konsumenter genom st&#xF6;d till aktiviteter fokuserade p&#xE5; de fyra st&#xF6;rsta utvecklingshindren: 1. L&#xE5;g produktivitet l&#xE4;ngs med hela v&#xE4;rdekedjan; 2. Otillr&#xE4;ckliga entrepren&#xF6;rskunskaper bland akt&#xF6;rer i hela v&#xE4;rdekedjan inklusive tj&#xE4;nsteleverant&#xF6;rer; 3. D&#xE5;lig marknadstillg&#xE5;ng f&#xF6;r v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rerna; och 4. Svaga och inadekvata strukturer och kapacitet f&#xF6;r r&#xE5;dgivning och koordination inom sektorn.

Insatsen f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till till fyra &#xF6;vergripande resultat: 1) &#xD6;kad produktivitet f&#xF6;r prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor; 2) St&#xE4;rkt entrepren&#xF6;rskap hos v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rer (VCA); 3) F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad marknadstillg&#xE5;ng f&#xF6;r prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekejdeakt&#xF6;rer; och 4. St&#xE4;rkta strukturer och kapacitet f&#xF6;r r&#xE5;dgivning och samarbete inom sektorn, speciellt inom den decentraliserade strukturen. Insatsen bed&#xF6;ms vara en f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttning f&#xF6;r landsbygdens strukturomvandling eftersom den f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till en kommersialisering av det sm&#xE5;skaliga jordbruket.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The overall goal of ASDSP II is &quot;to support transformation of crop, livestock and fisheries production into commercially oriented Enterprises that ensure sustainable food and nutrition security. The programme has a purpose &quot;to develop sustainable priority value chains for improved income, employment, food and nutrition security&quot;. To attain this purpose, the programme will aim to address three main problems: Low value chain productivity; inadequate entrepreneurial skills of value chain actors; low access to markets by value chain actors; and weak and inadequate structures and capacaties for consultation, cooperation, and coordination within the sector. 

The proposed intervention is a five year programme commencing activities in September 2017 and has specific objectives linked to addressing four key agricultural value chain problems as: 1. Improved productivity of priority value chains; 2. Entepreneurial skills of priority value chain actors strengthened; 3. Access to markets by priority value chains actors improved; and 4. Structures and capacities for consultation and, collaboration, cooperation and coordination in the sector strengthened.</narrative>

Enligt den interna slututv&#xE4;rderingen har programmet uppn&#xE5;tt goda resultat, bland annat f&#xF6;ljande: etablerande av strukturer och institutioner som beh&#xF6;vs f&#xF6;r utvecklingen av tre prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor per region; introduktion och st&#xE4;rkande av kapacitet f&#xF6;r att kunna utveckla v&#xE4;rdekedjor p&#xE5; nya s&#xE4;tt d&#xE4;r den privata sektorn och andra intressenter (huvudsakligen den privata sektorn) involveras, det har &#xE4;ven genomf&#xF6;rts andra v&#xE4;rdekedjeinitiativ; man har n&#xE5;tt ut till 563.347 v&#xE4;rdekejdeakt&#xF6;rer (46 % manliga, 36 % kvinnliga och 18 % ungdomar); &#xF6;kade inkomster (78 % f&#xF6;r manliga f&#xF6;retagare eller hush&#xE5;ll,  25 % f&#xF6;r kvinnliga hush&#xE5;ll och 15 % f&#xF6;r ungdomshush&#xE5;ll); &#xF6;kad livsmedelss&#xE4;kerhet fr&#xE5;n 61 %, 58 % respektive 61 % fr&#xE5;n utg&#xE5;ngsl&#xE4;get 32,8 %, 38 % respektive  42 % under 2016 f&#xF6;r manliga, kvinnliga respektive ungdomshush&#xE5;ll; &#xF6;kad produktivitet i prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor som mejerin&#xE4;ring och bananodling. Utv&#xE4;rderingen p&#xE5;visar &#xE4;ven v&#xE4;rdet av utvecklingsakt&#xF6;rer och regering att fungera som facilitatorer. 

Syftet med ASDSP II &#xE4;r att st&#xF6;dja omst&#xE4;llningen av jordbruks-, boskaps- och fiskeproduktion till kommersiellt orienterade f&#xF6;retag f&#xF6;r s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;llande av en h&#xE5;llbar livsmedels- och matf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning. Syftet &#xE4;r att utveckla prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor (VC) f&#xF6;r syssels&#xE4;ttning, &#xF6;kade inkomster och och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad livsmedels- och matf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjningen. Detta ska ske genom att man sammanf&#xF6;r de olika v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rerna (VCA) s&#xE5; att utvecklingshinder kan &#xF6;verbryggas och v&#xE4;rdekedjorna utvecklas p&#xE5; ett r&#xE4;ttvist och h&#xE5;llbart s&#xE4;tt. ASDSP II &#xE4;r f&#xF6;rankrat genom den nya jordbrukspolitiken (Agriculture Policy, AP) och bygger p&#xE5; resultaten fr&#xE5;n ASDSP I samt det man l&#xE4;rt fr&#xE5;n andra program inom denna sektor. Insatsen riktar sig till alla VCA:er, fr&#xE5;n prim&#xE4;ra producenter till konsumenter genom st&#xF6;d till aktiviteter fokuserade p&#xE5; de fyra st&#xF6;rsta utvecklingshindren: 1. L&#xE5;g produktivitet l&#xE4;ngs med hela v&#xE4;rdekedjan; 2. Otillr&#xE4;ckliga entrepren&#xF6;rskunskaper bland akt&#xF6;rer i hela v&#xE4;rdekedjan inklusive tj&#xE4;nsteleverant&#xF6;rer; 3. D&#xE5;lig marknadstillg&#xE5;ng f&#xF6;r v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rerna; och 4. Svaga och inadekvata strukturer och kapacitet f&#xF6;r r&#xE5;dgivning och koordination inom sektorn.

Insatsen f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till till fyra &#xF6;vergripande resultat: 1) &#xD6;kad produktivitet f&#xF6;r prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekedjor; 2) St&#xE4;rkt entrepren&#xF6;rskap hos v&#xE4;rdekedjeakt&#xF6;rer (VCA); 3) F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad marknadstillg&#xE5;ng f&#xF6;r prioriterade v&#xE4;rdekejdeakt&#xF6;rer; och 4. St&#xE4;rkta strukturer och kapacitet f&#xF6;r r&#xE5;dgivning och samarbete inom sektorn, speciellt inom den decentraliserade strukturen. Insatsen bed&#xF6;ms vara en f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttning f&#xF6;r landsbygdens strukturomvandling eftersom den f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas bidra till en kommersialisering av det sm&#xE5;skaliga jordbruket.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The overall goal of ASDSP II is &quot;to support transformation of crop, livestock and fisheries production into commercially oriented Enterprises that ensure sustainable food and nutrition security. The programme has a purpose &quot;to develop sustainable priority value chains for improved income, employment, food and nutrition security&quot;. To attain this purpose, the programme will aim to address three main problems: Low value chain productivity; inadequate entrepreneurial skills of value chain actors; low access to markets by value chain actors; and weak and inadequate structures and capacaties for consultation, cooperation, and coordination within the sector. 

The proposed intervention is a five year programme commencing activities in September 2017 and has specific objectives linked to addressing four key agricultural value chain problems as: 1. Improved productivity of priority value chains; 2. Entepreneurial skills of priority value chain actors strengthened; 3. Access to markets by priority value chains actors improved; and 4. Structures and capacities for consultation and, collaboration, cooperation and coordination in the sector strengthened.</narrative>

Finalization of Strategic Integrated Value Chain Action Plans (SIVCAPs) for all the counties 2. Finalization of the baseline and integration of findings into planning and results framework 3. Finalization of Gender and Sicial Inclusion survey and action plan for integration into the SIVCAPs Output level results attained within the four outcome areas are: Outcome 1. Productivity of priority value chains increased: A&#xA0;total of 135 opportunities were identified on increasing productivity during the report year; 1,410 innovations were identified for support; and 310 CSA and GG technologies were realised for integration into the value chains.&#xA0; Outcome 2. Entrepreneur skills of VCAs and service providers enhanced: 70% completion of database and 13% of the planned service providers were trained on entrepreneurial skill and 24% of the planned VCAs had viable business plans.&#xA0; Outcome 3: Access to market by VCAs improved:&#xA0;149(16%) VCA groups were aggregated, 256(18%) market linkages established, 345 market service providers and 140,000(74%) were accessing markets. For COVID 19 adaptation, the programme facilitated the collection of food stocks data for the GoK strategic planning; policy influence and decision making with respect to realization of food and nutrition security during the pandemic period. Outcome 4, Structures and capacities for consultation, coordination and cooperation in the sector strengthened: &#xA0;Operationalization of &#xA0;77% County Agricultural Sector Steering Committees (CASSCOMs), Capacity building of the established national, county and inter-governmental structures; 143 operational partnerships were established, 17 counties were sensitized and developed roadmaps for policy domestication in collaboration with GIZ and RTI, and 5 regulations related to the priority value chain were supported.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
Kenyas regering (GoK) har bett Sverige att bidra till genomf&#xF6;randet av landets s.k. Vision 2030, den nya jordbrukspolicyn samt s.k. Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS 2010 &#x2013; 2020) genom fortsatt finansiering till jordbrukssektorn via ASDSP programmet (Agricultural Sector Development Support Programme, fas II) under aktivitetsperioden 2017-2022 och r&#xE4;kenskaps&#xE5;ret juli 2017 till juni 2022.  Kenyas egen finansiering till programmet uppg&#xE5;r till 2 092 500 000 KES, varav KES 1 292 500 000 kommer fr&#xE5;n landets 47 regionstyrelser och KES 800 000 000 fr&#xE5;n landets regering. Sverige har tillfr&#xE5;gats om att st&#xF6;dja programmet genom att tillhandah&#xE5;lla ekonomisk och teknisk hj&#xE4;lp motsvarande SEK 352 126 500, vilket &#xE4;ven inkluderar EU-delegerade bidrag p&#xE5; SEK 52 126 500. EU-delegering baseras p&#xE5; positiva erfarenheter fr&#xE5;n samarbetet mellan EU, Sverige och Tyskland under fas 1 av programmet mellan 2014 och 2016. EU-&#xF6;verenskommelsen har gjorts i enlighet med det s.k. Action Document som g&#xE4;ller &quot;st&#xF6;d till jordbrukssektorns transformeringsprocess samt en decentraliserad markf&#xF6;rvaltning&quot;. Detta godk&#xE4;ndes av Europakommissionen 2015 (KE/FED/037-776) och finansierades genom  EU-Kenya Cooperation 11th European Development Fund National Indicative Programme f&#xF6;r perioden 2014-2020. Grunden till avtalet mellan Sverige och EU var handlingsplanen &quot;transformation av jordbrukssektorn i Kenya&quot;, som utformades i december 2016. Planen syftar till att utveckla strukturer och kapaciteten f&#xF6;r en bredare sektor&#xF6;verskridande r&#xE5;dgivning och koordination p&#xE5; nationell, mellanstatlig och regional niv&#xE5; i syfte att st&#xE4;rka de policies och institutioner som p&#xE5;verkar v&#xE4;rdekedjornas utveckling. Resultaten f&#xF6;r EU-delegeringen &#xE4;r prim&#xE4;rt sammankopplade med  ASDSP II Outcome 4. EU-bidragen &#xE4;r emellertid inte &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta utan kommer att f&#xF6;ljas upp och rapporteras tillsammans med &#xF6;vriga medel.

To attain this purpose, the programme will aim to address three main problems: Low value chain productivity; inadequate entrepreneurial skills of value chain actors; low access to markets by value chain actors; and weak and inadequate structures and capacaties for consultation, cooperation, and coordination within the sector. 

The proposed intervention is a five year programme commencing activities in September 2017 and has specific objectives linked to addressing four key agricultural value chain problems as: 1. Improved productivity of priority value chains; 2. Entepreneurial skills of priority value chain actors strengthened; 3. Access to markets by priority value chains actors improved; and 4. Structures and capacities for consultation and, collaboration, cooperation and coordination in the sector strengthened.</narrative>

Financial Sector Deepening Program (FSDK) finansieras gemensamt av flera givare och verkar i Kenya via en stiftelse, eller Trust. FSDK etablerades f&#xF6;r att befr&#xE4;mja en utveckling av finanssektorn samt f&#xF6;r &#xF6;ka fattiga m&#xE4;nniskors tillg&#xE5;ng till finansiella tj&#xE4;nster i Kenya. FSDK:s strategim&#xE5;l f&#xF6;r 2016-2021 &#xE4;r att &quot;&#xE5;stadkomma varaktiga f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttringar av kenyanska l&#xE5;ginkomsttagares levnadsf&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llanden&quot;. I detta ing&#xE5;r att hitta m&#xF6;jligheter att skapa resiliens, h&#xE5;llbarhet och f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade levnadsf&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llanden f&#xF6;r l&#xE5;ginkomsttagare. Det specifika m&#xE5;let &#xE4;r att &quot;utveckla ett finansiellt system som skapar ett verkligt v&#xE4;rde f&#xF6;r l&#xE5;ginkomsttagare i Kenya&quot;. Detta ska ske genom att samarbeta med marknadsakt&#xF6;rer i syfte att undanr&#xF6;ja de hinder som finns f&#xF6;r ett inkluderande system: 1. H&#xF6;g kostnad; 2. otillr&#xE4;ckligt v&#xE4;rde; och 3. l&#xE5;gt f&#xF6;rtroende. F&#xF6;r att &#xE5;stadkomma detta vill man bygga upp kapacitet hos akt&#xF6;rerna s&#xE5; att de kan arbeta f&#xF6;r att undanr&#xF6;ja hinder och hitta innovativa l&#xF6;sningar som kommer fattiga m&#xE4;nniskor och f&#xF6;retag till del. I detta ing&#xE5;r att: &#xE4;ndra spelreglerna och &#xF6;ka incitamenten f&#xF6;r att gynna fattiga; f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra effektiviteten inom branschen; samt befr&#xE4;mja en samsyn om finanssektorns utveckling.

Den reviderade budgeten, efter att DFID avbrutit sitt st&#xF6;d till programmet Financial Inclusion, uppg&#xE5;r till 3,188 miljarder KES, varav 1,622 miljarder KES redan s&#xE4;krats av Gates Foundation och 1,086 miljarder KES &#xF6;verf&#xF6;rts fr&#xE5;n tidigare strategist&#xF6;d (i januari 2017). Sverige ombeds bidra med 0,48 miljarder KES (50 MSEK).</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The Financial Sector Deepening (FSDK) Program  is a multi-donor programme operating in Kenya through a Trust association modality. FSDK was established to facilitate the development of the financial sector and to increase the access for poor people to financial services in Kenya. FSDK Strategy 2016-2021 goal is &#x201C;to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya&#x201D; which entail seeking opportunities which build resilience, growth and improvement in quality of life for the low-income Groups. The specific objective is  &#x201C;to develop a financial system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya&#x201D;. This will be articulated through working with market players to address three key barriers to inclusion including: 1. High cost; 2. Insufficient value; and 3. Weak trust. Key approach to attainment of this is building capacity for the market to address market barriers and innovate solutions for real world needs of poor people and businesses by addressing market challenges (outcomes) which include: rules of the game (which shift incentives in favour of the poor); enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and promoting a shared collective vision on development of the Financial Services Sector.

The revised budgetary requirement following DFID exit from support to core Financial Inclusion programme is BKES 3.188 out of which BKES 1.622 has already been secured from Gates Foundation and  BKES 1.086 is a carryover from previous strategy support (as at January 2017). Sweden is requested to provide BKES 0.48 (MSEK 50).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention has two components namely financial inclusion and trade facilitation. The intended outcome is to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya through development of a financial and trade system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya. The objectives of this intervention; both financial inclusion and trade facilitation is anchored on working with market players to address three key bariers to inclusion namely i) high cost;ii) insufficient value; and iii) weak trust in the system
While the specific approach to attainment of these objectives of reducing costs, creating value and building trust in both the financial and trade market system relies on building the capacity of the market to work with key areas including: rules of the game which shift incentives in favour of the poor; enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and&#xA0; promoting a shared collective vision on development of the financial services sector (FSS). Additionally, trade facilitation for the real economy aims at creating market capacity and incentives to innovate trade solutions which deliver real value for the economy, enterprises and households.
The rationale behind the trade facilitation is that the trade system must evolve in a way that it only allocates value to trading partners in line with the value they have added within the system and by breaking down information asymmetries.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">FSD Kenya&#x2019;s projects are organised into four areas based on the financial market development outcomes outlined in its theory of change. These are: (i) Long-term vision and policy, (ii) Regulation, (iii) Financial infrastructure, and (iv) Innovation. Progress in each area and the crosscutting functions are described below. Projects under long term vision and policy included recent FSDK technical support led to the creation of a new Kenya Government Digital economy strategy blueprint (2019) launched by the Kenyan president and the recognition of Digital Finance as a flagship project highlighting the importance of the financial sector development policy (from 2005) to formally encompass financial access as a policy priority alongside efficiency and stability. A trusted partner of the National Treasury, FSD Kenya has been directly engaged in the development of successive Vision 2030 medium-term plans for the financial services sector. FSD Kenya initiated the first comprehensive market survey on financial inclusion (FinAccess Household Survey report) and supported it to becoming a sustainable part of the government statistical architecture, the study which has become the most valuable financial inclusion tracking instrument is jointly done every three years by FSDK, Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . Kenya continues to be considered at the frontier in Africa, particularly given the scale and role of mobile money and fintech in both driving financial inclusion but also creating new areas of concern. Market information built on the success of the FinAccess household survey report 2019 launch garnered support for sustainability and use of FinAccess as well as the potential to complement this with the supply side data intervention. Other several successful events were held highlighting the value of segmentation and how to use data to develop more inclusive financial solutions. Under the Regulatory system development, the interest rate controls introduced in September 2016 were abolished in 2019, which is expected to have a positive impact on credit growth especially with regard to micro and small medium enterprises access to finance, financial integration and tax revenues. Additionally, work on regulation by FSD Kenya helped establish the new enabling regulatory frameworks which have underpinned the expansion of financial inclusion and fintech innovation in Kenya. This has included regulation for deposit-taking microfinance and financial co-operatives, the regulatory response which enabled the emergence of the M-Pesa mobile-money platform, agent banking, electronic payments and the first regulatory sandbox for fintech in Kenya (under the Capital Markets Authority). Under stability, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Sandbox continues to progress well and has inspired a promising conversation at the annual joint financial sector regulators forum about a sector-wide approach to innovation. Competition work has resulted in enhanced disclosure in both digital and non-digital realms. Reflecting Kenya&#x2019;s success in encouraging the development of digital finance, regulators from across the continent and beyond have sought to learn from the Kenya approach facilitated by FSD Kenya in collaboration with the FSD Network. FinAccess Household Survey report 2019 revealed that mobile money users have substantially more challenges than users of regulated financial services like banks and mobile banks, with nearly 30% experiencing loss of money or fraud. Thus, Kenya&#x2019;s financial stability is linked to innovation both in the financial sector and more broadly. The results of this work are clearly evident in the 2019 Financial Access Household Survey, where formal financial inclusion has risen from 26.7% of adults in 2006 to 82.9% in 2019, while complete exclusion of financial access and services has dropped from 41.3% of adults in 2006 to 11.0% in 2019. The informal financial sector declined from 32.1% in 2006 to 6.1% in 2019; the &#x201C;excluded&#x201D; category &#x2013; the &#x201C;unbankable&#x201D; &#x2013; declined from 41.3% in 2006 to 11% in 2019. PWC&#x2019;s Africa Business Agenda 2019 indicated that Kenya is number 1 in Africa in the growth of innovative companies. A key area of focus going forward in Kenya will be to drive for financial stability and market integrity particularly with regards market conduct, while supporting financial innovation that drives inclusive growth. Significant gains have been achieved in improving financial infrastructure. FSD Kenya was involved in the inception of credit information sharing which now encompasses most of the formal financial system although more work is needed as credit markets continue to evolve. So far there are atleast three credit Reference Bureaus ( Credit Reference Bureau Africa Limited, Metropol Credit Reference Bureau limited and Creditinfo Credit Reference Bureau Kenya Ltd) licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya to collect and collate credit information on individuals and businesses from different sources and provide that information upon request mainly by credit providers in the form of a credit report. Support for interoperability in the payments system resulted in the creation of a new proto-national switch by the Kenya Bankers Association which has already resulted in market price improvements. This has for example resulted in scaling up of the interbank money transfer solution (PesaLink), which has moved Kenya further toward a cashless society with more financial inclusivity. FSD Kenya pioneered the use of the financial sector to deliver social protection payments in Kenya through support of the UKAid initiated Hunger Safety Net Programme and used that experience to support the launch of the government&#x2019;s Inua Jamii programme in 2005 now supporting 1.2m low-income beneficiaries. Inua Jamii is owned by the Government and last year 2019 saw the close-out of Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) and the government fully taking charge of the social protection programmes. Payment platforms picked up speed with progress on the National Payments System Strategy, filling key positions at Integrated Payment Services Limited (IPSL) and the Payments Association of Kenya (PAK), and initiating new work on the cash-digital interface. Aside from closing out HSNP, the rest of the Government payments work is progressing well on biometric standard interoperability, support to the Government Digital Payments (GDP) team and the ongoing support to Inua Jamii. Under Innovations, Trade facilitation and Building livelihoods both had strong progress in 2019 while the Financial innovations for the real economy (FIRE) project was on track with existing activities but behind plan on new work. The Trade project which is a public private development partnership with Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI), Export Promotion and Brand Kenya (BrandKe), the technology provider Retail Pay Limited and the agreement partner FSDK, witnessed the full launch of the RetailPay pilot, which is a transparent system to facilitate trade end-to-end and operational support as well as key interventions initiated with consortium partners. Significant activity is underway with the Marsabit graduation pilot. The programme was initiated with the aim of testing market-based approaches to building livelihoods of very poor people; and to develop an understanding of how effectively link graduation support with market development in order to increase income and resilience among very poor households in Marsabit County, Northern Kenya. Initial results from the field monitoring visit to Marsabit (see field vist report) reveal a more positive picture about the impact of the graduation work and call into question whether the project should be closed this year or extended to ensure full sustainability. Generally, Innovation has been a centrepiece of the FSD Kenya programme from the outset and today Kenya is positioned globally as a leading innovator in financial inclusion and fintech. Direct support for the development of the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA)/M-Pesa M-Shwari digital savings and credit solution (25.8m accounts opened since inception) has resulted in highly competitive market for digital finance. This solution has been replicated in many additional markets across Africa and beyond. Investment in establishing a novel shared management services network for 38 financial services associations (village banks) serving 300,000 low-income rural households most with no access to the formal financial service providers (except M-Pesa). FSD Kenya helped created new models to scale-up improved community-based savings groups &#x2013; currently used by over one million poor households in Kenya. This work has been leveraged by other FSDs in Mozambique and Zambia. More recent work has supported experimentation with fintechs working at the intersection of finance and real-economy areas like agriculture and health. FSD Kenya&#x2019;s cross-cutting functions continue to support the programme effectively. Building on the full roll-out of the project data management system, the results function supported the projects to ensure activity is aligned with objectives. Beyond the system, Results also engaged with the FSD Network process of aligning indicators on impact, carried out internal reviews through field visits and facilitated a new cross-project effort to generate case studies on the sustainability of FSD&#x2019;s impact.  FSD Kenya has solidified its position as the go-to source of information on financial inclusion in Kenya. In the third quarter alone of 2019, there were 62 mentions of FSD Kenya&#x2019;s work in the press, 7 blogs published by the team (including one turned into an Op-ed at the request of one of the leading main stream newspapers in Kenya -Daily Nation) and increased social media engagement. According to the World Bank, it has become much easier to do business in Kenya and Kenya&#x2019;s robust digital economy is mentioned as the most significant contributor to this success. In the Bank&apos;s Ease of Doing Business Index, Kenya ranked 61 out of 190 countries in 2019, up from 136 in 2015</narrative>

Den reviderade budgeten, efter att DFID avbrutit sitt st&#xF6;d till programmet Financial Inclusion, uppg&#xE5;r till 3,188 miljarder KES, varav 1,622 miljarder KES redan s&#xE4;krats av Gates Foundation och 1,086 miljarder KES &#xF6;verf&#xF6;rts fr&#xE5;n tidigare strategist&#xF6;d (i januari 2017). Sverige ombeds bidra med 0,48 miljarder KES (50 MSEK).</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The Financial Sector Deepening (FSDK) Program  is a multi-donor programme operating in Kenya through a Trust association modality. FSDK was established to facilitate the development of the financial sector and to increase the access for poor people to financial services in Kenya. FSDK Strategy 2016-2021 goal is &#x201C;to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya&#x201D; which entail seeking opportunities which build resilience, growth and improvement in quality of life for the low-income Groups. The specific objective is  &#x201C;to develop a financial system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya&#x201D;. This will be articulated through working with market players to address three key barriers to inclusion including: 1. High cost; 2. Insufficient value; and 3. Weak trust. Key approach to attainment of this is building capacity for the market to address market barriers and innovate solutions for real world needs of poor people and businesses by addressing market challenges (outcomes) which include: rules of the game (which shift incentives in favour of the poor); enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and promoting a shared collective vision on development of the Financial Services Sector.

The revised budgetary requirement following DFID exit from support to core Financial Inclusion programme is BKES 3.188 out of which BKES 1.622 has already been secured from Gates Foundation and  BKES 1.086 is a carryover from previous strategy support (as at January 2017). Sweden is requested to provide BKES 0.48 (MSEK 50).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention has two components namely financial inclusion and trade facilitation. The intended outcome is to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya through development of a financial and trade system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya. The objectives of this intervention; both financial inclusion and trade facilitation is anchored on working with market players to address three key bariers to inclusion namely i) high cost;ii) insufficient value; and iii) weak trust in the system
While the specific approach to attainment of these objectives of reducing costs, creating value and building trust in both the financial and trade market system relies on building the capacity of the market to work with key areas including: rules of the game which shift incentives in favour of the poor; enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and&#xA0; promoting a shared collective vision on development of the financial services sector (FSS). Additionally, trade facilitation for the real economy aims at creating market capacity and incentives to innovate trade solutions which deliver real value for the economy, enterprises and households.
The rationale behind the trade facilitation is that the trade system must evolve in a way that it only allocates value to trading partners in line with the value they have added within the system and by breaking down information asymmetries.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">FSD Kenya&#x2019;s projects are organised into four areas based on the financial market development outcomes outlined in its theory of change. These are: (i) Long-term vision and policy, (ii) Regulation, (iii) Financial infrastructure, and (iv) Innovation. Progress in each area and the crosscutting functions are described below. Projects under long term vision and policy included recent FSDK technical support led to the creation of a new Kenya Government Digital economy strategy blueprint (2019) launched by the Kenyan president and the recognition of Digital Finance as a flagship project highlighting the importance of the financial sector development policy (from 2005) to formally encompass financial access as a policy priority alongside efficiency and stability. A trusted partner of the National Treasury, FSD Kenya has been directly engaged in the development of successive Vision 2030 medium-term plans for the financial services sector. FSD Kenya initiated the first comprehensive market survey on financial inclusion (FinAccess Household Survey report) and supported it to becoming a sustainable part of the government statistical architecture, the study which has become the most valuable financial inclusion tracking instrument is jointly done every three years by FSDK, Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . Kenya continues to be considered at the frontier in Africa, particularly given the scale and role of mobile money and fintech in both driving financial inclusion but also creating new areas of concern. Market information built on the success of the FinAccess household survey report 2019 launch garnered support for sustainability and use of FinAccess as well as the potential to complement this with the supply side data intervention. Other several successful events were held highlighting the value of segmentation and how to use data to develop more inclusive financial solutions. Under the Regulatory system development, the interest rate controls introduced in September 2016 were abolished in 2019, which is expected to have a positive impact on credit growth especially with regard to micro and small medium enterprises access to finance, financial integration and tax revenues. Additionally, work on regulation by FSD Kenya helped establish the new enabling regulatory frameworks which have underpinned the expansion of financial inclusion and fintech innovation in Kenya. This has included regulation for deposit-taking microfinance and financial co-operatives, the regulatory response which enabled the emergence of the M-Pesa mobile-money platform, agent banking, electronic payments and the first regulatory sandbox for fintech in Kenya (under the Capital Markets Authority). Under stability, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Sandbox continues to progress well and has inspired a promising conversation at the annual joint financial sector regulators forum about a sector-wide approach to innovation. Competition work has resulted in enhanced disclosure in both digital and non-digital realms. Reflecting Kenya&#x2019;s success in encouraging the development of digital finance, regulators from across the continent and beyond have sought to learn from the Kenya approach facilitated by FSD Kenya in collaboration with the FSD Network. FinAccess Household Survey report 2019 revealed that mobile money users have substantially more challenges than users of regulated financial services like banks and mobile banks, with nearly 30% experiencing loss of money or fraud. Thus, Kenya&#x2019;s financial stability is linked to innovation both in the financial sector and more broadly. The results of this work are clearly evident in the 2019 Financial Access Household Survey, where formal financial inclusion has risen from 26.7% of adults in 2006 to 82.9% in 2019, while complete exclusion of financial access and services has dropped from 41.3% of adults in 2006 to 11.0% in 2019. The informal financial sector declined from 32.1% in 2006 to 6.1% in 2019; the &#x201C;excluded&#x201D; category &#x2013; the &#x201C;unbankable&#x201D; &#x2013; declined from 41.3% in 2006 to 11% in 2019. PWC&#x2019;s Africa Business Agenda 2019 indicated that Kenya is number 1 in Africa in the growth of innovative companies. A key area of focus going forward in Kenya will be to drive for financial stability and market integrity particularly with regards market conduct, while supporting financial innovation that drives inclusive growth. Significant gains have been achieved in improving financial infrastructure. FSD Kenya was involved in the inception of credit information sharing which now encompasses most of the formal financial system although more work is needed as credit markets continue to evolve. So far there are atleast three credit Reference Bureaus ( Credit Reference Bureau Africa Limited, Metropol Credit Reference Bureau limited and Creditinfo Credit Reference Bureau Kenya Ltd) licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya to collect and collate credit information on individuals and businesses from different sources and provide that information upon request mainly by credit providers in the form of a credit report. Support for interoperability in the payments system resulted in the creation of a new proto-national switch by the Kenya Bankers Association which has already resulted in market price improvements. This has for example resulted in scaling up of the interbank money transfer solution (PesaLink), which has moved Kenya further toward a cashless society with more financial inclusivity. FSD Kenya pioneered the use of the financial sector to deliver social protection payments in Kenya through support of the UKAid initiated Hunger Safety Net Programme and used that experience to support the launch of the government&#x2019;s Inua Jamii programme in 2005 now supporting 1.2m low-income beneficiaries. Inua Jamii is owned by the Government and last year 2019 saw the close-out of Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) and the government fully taking charge of the social protection programmes. Payment platforms picked up speed with progress on the National Payments System Strategy, filling key positions at Integrated Payment Services Limited (IPSL) and the Payments Association of Kenya (PAK), and initiating new work on the cash-digital interface. Aside from closing out HSNP, the rest of the Government payments work is progressing well on biometric standard interoperability, support to the Government Digital Payments (GDP) team and the ongoing support to Inua Jamii. Under Innovations, Trade facilitation and Building livelihoods both had strong progress in 2019 while the Financial innovations for the real economy (FIRE) project was on track with existing activities but behind plan on new work. The Trade project which is a public private development partnership with Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI), Export Promotion and Brand Kenya (BrandKe), the technology provider Retail Pay Limited and the agreement partner FSDK, witnessed the full launch of the RetailPay pilot, which is a transparent system to facilitate trade end-to-end and operational support as well as key interventions initiated with consortium partners. Significant activity is underway with the Marsabit graduation pilot. The programme was initiated with the aim of testing market-based approaches to building livelihoods of very poor people; and to develop an understanding of how effectively link graduation support with market development in order to increase income and resilience among very poor households in Marsabit County, Northern Kenya. Initial results from the field monitoring visit to Marsabit (see field vist report) reveal a more positive picture about the impact of the graduation work and call into question whether the project should be closed this year or extended to ensure full sustainability. Generally, Innovation has been a centrepiece of the FSD Kenya programme from the outset and today Kenya is positioned globally as a leading innovator in financial inclusion and fintech. Direct support for the development of the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA)/M-Pesa M-Shwari digital savings and credit solution (25.8m accounts opened since inception) has resulted in highly competitive market for digital finance. This solution has been replicated in many additional markets across Africa and beyond. Investment in establishing a novel shared management services network for 38 financial services associations (village banks) serving 300,000 low-income rural households most with no access to the formal financial service providers (except M-Pesa). FSD Kenya helped created new models to scale-up improved community-based savings groups &#x2013; currently used by over one million poor households in Kenya. This work has been leveraged by other FSDs in Mozambique and Zambia. More recent work has supported experimentation with fintechs working at the intersection of finance and real-economy areas like agriculture and health. FSD Kenya&#x2019;s cross-cutting functions continue to support the programme effectively. Building on the full roll-out of the project data management system, the results function supported the projects to ensure activity is aligned with objectives. Beyond the system, Results also engaged with the FSD Network process of aligning indicators on impact, carried out internal reviews through field visits and facilitated a new cross-project effort to generate case studies on the sustainability of FSD&#x2019;s impact.  FSD Kenya has solidified its position as the go-to source of information on financial inclusion in Kenya. In the third quarter alone of 2019, there were 62 mentions of FSD Kenya&#x2019;s work in the press, 7 blogs published by the team (including one turned into an Op-ed at the request of one of the leading main stream newspapers in Kenya -Daily Nation) and increased social media engagement. According to the World Bank, it has become much easier to do business in Kenya and Kenya&#x2019;s robust digital economy is mentioned as the most significant contributor to this success. In the Bank&apos;s Ease of Doing Business Index, Kenya ranked 61 out of 190 countries in 2019, up from 136 in 2015</narrative>

Financial Sector Deepening Program (FSDK) finansieras gemensamt av flera givare och verkar i Kenya via en stiftelse, eller Trust. FSDK etablerades f&#xF6;r att befr&#xE4;mja en utveckling av finanssektorn samt f&#xF6;r &#xF6;ka fattiga m&#xE4;nniskors tillg&#xE5;ng till finansiella tj&#xE4;nster i Kenya.

Den reviderade budgeten, efter att DFID avbrutit sitt st&#xF6;d till programmet Financial Inclusion, uppg&#xE5;r till 3,188 miljarder KES, varav 1,622 miljarder KES redan s&#xE4;krats av Gates Foundation och 1,086 miljarder KES &#xF6;verf&#xF6;rts fr&#xE5;n tidigare strategist&#xF6;d (i januari 2017). Sverige ombeds bidra med 0,48 miljarder KES (50 MSEK).</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The Financial Sector Deepening (FSDK) Program  is a multi-donor programme operating in Kenya through a Trust association modality. FSDK was established to facilitate the development of the financial sector and to increase the access for poor people to financial services in Kenya. FSDK Strategy 2016-2021 goal is &#x201C;to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya&#x201D; which entail seeking opportunities which build resilience, growth and improvement in quality of life for the low-income Groups. The specific objective is  &#x201C;to develop a financial system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya&#x201D;. This will be articulated through working with market players to address three key barriers to inclusion including: 1. High cost; 2. Insufficient value; and 3. Weak trust. Key approach to attainment of this is building capacity for the market to address market barriers and innovate solutions for real world needs of poor people and businesses by addressing market challenges (outcomes) which include: rules of the game (which shift incentives in favour of the poor); enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and promoting a shared collective vision on development of the Financial Services Sector.

The revised budgetary requirement following DFID exit from support to core Financial Inclusion programme is BKES 3.188 out of which BKES 1.622 has already been secured from Gates Foundation and  BKES 1.086 is a carryover from previous strategy support (as at January 2017). Sweden is requested to provide BKES 0.48 (MSEK 50).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention has two components namely financial inclusion and trade facilitation. The intended outcome is to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya through development of a financial and trade system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya. The objectives of this intervention; both financial inclusion and trade facilitation is anchored on working with market players to address three key bariers to inclusion namely i) high cost;ii) insufficient value; and iii) weak trust in the system
While the specific approach to attainment of these objectives of reducing costs, creating value and building trust in both the financial and trade market system relies on building the capacity of the market to work with key areas including: rules of the game which shift incentives in favour of the poor; enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and&#xA0; promoting a shared collective vision on development of the financial services sector (FSS). Additionally, trade facilitation for the real economy aims at creating market capacity and incentives to innovate trade solutions which deliver real value for the economy, enterprises and households.
The rationale behind the trade facilitation is that the trade system must evolve in a way that it only allocates value to trading partners in line with the value they have added within the system and by breaking down information asymmetries.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">FSD Kenya&#x2019;s projects are organised into four areas based on the financial market development outcomes outlined in its theory of change. These are: (i) Long-term vision and policy, (ii) Regulation, (iii) Financial infrastructure, and (iv) Innovation. Progress in each area and the crosscutting functions are described below. Projects under long term vision and policy included recent FSDK technical support led to the creation of a new Kenya Government Digital economy strategy blueprint (2019) launched by the Kenyan president and the recognition of Digital Finance as a flagship project highlighting the importance of the financial sector development policy (from 2005) to formally encompass financial access as a policy priority alongside efficiency and stability. A trusted partner of the National Treasury, FSD Kenya has been directly engaged in the development of successive Vision 2030 medium-term plans for the financial services sector. FSD Kenya initiated the first comprehensive market survey on financial inclusion (FinAccess Household Survey report) and supported it to becoming a sustainable part of the government statistical architecture, the study which has become the most valuable financial inclusion tracking instrument is jointly done every three years by FSDK, Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . Kenya continues to be considered at the frontier in Africa, particularly given the scale and role of mobile money and fintech in both driving financial inclusion but also creating new areas of concern. Market information built on the success of the FinAccess household survey report 2019 launch garnered support for sustainability and use of FinAccess as well as the potential to complement this with the supply side data intervention. Other several successful events were held highlighting the value of segmentation and how to use data to develop more inclusive financial solutions. Under the Regulatory system development, the interest rate controls introduced in September 2016 were abolished in 2019, which is expected to have a positive impact on credit growth especially with regard to micro and small medium enterprises access to finance, financial integration and tax revenues. Additionally, work on regulation by FSD Kenya helped establish the new enabling regulatory frameworks which have underpinned the expansion of financial inclusion and fintech innovation in Kenya. This has included regulation for deposit-taking microfinance and financial co-operatives, the regulatory response which enabled the emergence of the M-Pesa mobile-money platform, agent banking, electronic payments and the first regulatory sandbox for fintech in Kenya (under the Capital Markets Authority). Under stability, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Sandbox continues to progress well and has inspired a promising conversation at the annual joint financial sector regulators forum about a sector-wide approach to innovation. Competition work has resulted in enhanced disclosure in both digital and non-digital realms. Reflecting Kenya&#x2019;s success in encouraging the development of digital finance, regulators from across the continent and beyond have sought to learn from the Kenya approach facilitated by FSD Kenya in collaboration with the FSD Network. FinAccess Household Survey report 2019 revealed that mobile money users have substantially more challenges than users of regulated financial services like banks and mobile banks, with nearly 30% experiencing loss of money or fraud. Thus, Kenya&#x2019;s financial stability is linked to innovation both in the financial sector and more broadly. The results of this work are clearly evident in the 2019 Financial Access Household Survey, where formal financial inclusion has risen from 26.7% of adults in 2006 to 82.9% in 2019, while complete exclusion of financial access and services has dropped from 41.3% of adults in 2006 to 11.0% in 2019. The informal financial sector declined from 32.1% in 2006 to 6.1% in 2019; the &#x201C;excluded&#x201D; category &#x2013; the &#x201C;unbankable&#x201D; &#x2013; declined from 41.3% in 2006 to 11% in 2019. PWC&#x2019;s Africa Business Agenda 2019 indicated that Kenya is number 1 in Africa in the growth of innovative companies. A key area of focus going forward in Kenya will be to drive for financial stability and market integrity particularly with regards market conduct, while supporting financial innovation that drives inclusive growth. Significant gains have been achieved in improving financial infrastructure. FSD Kenya was involved in the inception of credit information sharing which now encompasses most of the formal financial system although more work is needed as credit markets continue to evolve. So far there are atleast three credit Reference Bureaus ( Credit Reference Bureau Africa Limited, Metropol Credit Reference Bureau limited and Creditinfo Credit Reference Bureau Kenya Ltd) licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya to collect and collate credit information on individuals and businesses from different sources and provide that information upon request mainly by credit providers in the form of a credit report. Support for interoperability in the payments system resulted in the creation of a new proto-national switch by the Kenya Bankers Association which has already resulted in market price improvements. This has for example resulted in scaling up of the interbank money transfer solution (PesaLink), which has moved Kenya further toward a cashless society with more financial inclusivity. FSD Kenya pioneered the use of the financial sector to deliver social protection payments in Kenya through support of the UKAid initiated Hunger Safety Net Programme and used that experience to support the launch of the government&#x2019;s Inua Jamii programme in 2005 now supporting 1.2m low-income beneficiaries. Inua Jamii is owned by the Government and last year 2019 saw the close-out of Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) and the government fully taking charge of the social protection programmes. Payment platforms picked up speed with progress on the National Payments System Strategy, filling key positions at Integrated Payment Services Limited (IPSL) and the Payments Association of Kenya (PAK), and initiating new work on the cash-digital interface. Aside from closing out HSNP, the rest of the Government payments work is progressing well on biometric standard interoperability, support to the Government Digital Payments (GDP) team and the ongoing support to Inua Jamii. Under Innovations, Trade facilitation and Building livelihoods both had strong progress in 2019 while the Financial innovations for the real economy (FIRE) project was on track with existing activities but behind plan on new work. The Trade project which is a public private development partnership with Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI), Export Promotion and Brand Kenya (BrandKe), the technology provider Retail Pay Limited and the agreement partner FSDK, witnessed the full launch of the RetailPay pilot, which is a transparent system to facilitate trade end-to-end and operational support as well as key interventions initiated with consortium partners. Significant activity is underway with the Marsabit graduation pilot. The programme was initiated with the aim of testing market-based approaches to building livelihoods of very poor people; and to develop an understanding of how effectively link graduation support with market development in order to increase income and resilience among very poor households in Marsabit County, Northern Kenya. Initial results from the field monitoring visit to Marsabit (see field vist report) reveal a more positive picture about the impact of the graduation work and call into question whether the project should be closed this year or extended to ensure full sustainability. Generally, Innovation has been a centrepiece of the FSD Kenya programme from the outset and today Kenya is positioned globally as a leading innovator in financial inclusion and fintech. Direct support for the development of the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA)/M-Pesa M-Shwari digital savings and credit solution (25.8m accounts opened since inception) has resulted in highly competitive market for digital finance. This solution has been replicated in many additional markets across Africa and beyond. Investment in establishing a novel shared management services network for 38 financial services associations (village banks) serving 300,000 low-income rural households most with no access to the formal financial service providers (except M-Pesa). FSD Kenya helped created new models to scale-up improved community-based savings groups &#x2013; currently used by over one million poor households in Kenya. This work has been leveraged by other FSDs in Mozambique and Zambia. More recent work has supported experimentation with fintechs working at the intersection of finance and real-economy areas like agriculture and health. FSD Kenya&#x2019;s cross-cutting functions continue to support the programme effectively. Building on the full roll-out of the project data management system, the results function supported the projects to ensure activity is aligned with objectives. Beyond the system, Results also engaged with the FSD Network process of aligning indicators on impact, carried out internal reviews through field visits and facilitated a new cross-project effort to generate case studies on the sustainability of FSD&#x2019;s impact.  FSD Kenya has solidified its position as the go-to source of information on financial inclusion in Kenya. In the third quarter alone of 2019, there were 62 mentions of FSD Kenya&#x2019;s work in the press, 7 blogs published by the team (including one turned into an Op-ed at the request of one of the leading main stream newspapers in Kenya -Daily Nation) and increased social media engagement. According to the World Bank, it has become much easier to do business in Kenya and Kenya&#x2019;s robust digital economy is mentioned as the most significant contributor to this success. In the Bank&apos;s Ease of Doing Business Index, Kenya ranked 61 out of 190 countries in 2019, up from 136 in 2015</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The Financial Sector Deepening (FSDK) Program  is a multi-donor programme operating in Kenya through a Trust association modality. FSDK was established to facilitate the development of the financial sector and to increase the access for poor people to financial services in Kenya. FSDK Strategy 2016-2021 goal is &#x201C;to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya&#x201D; which entail seeking opportunities which build resilience, growth and improvement in quality of life for the low-income Groups. The specific objective is  &#x201C;to develop a financial system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya&#x201D;. This will be articulated through working with market players to address three key barriers to inclusion including: 1. High cost; 2. Insufficient value; and 3. Weak trust. Key approach to attainment of this is building capacity for the market to address market barriers and innovate solutions for real world needs of poor people and businesses by addressing market challenges (outcomes) which include: rules of the game (which shift incentives in favour of the poor); enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and promoting a shared collective vision on development of the Financial Services Sector.

The revised budgetary requirement following DFID exit from support to core Financial Inclusion programme is BKES 3.188 out of which BKES 1.622 has already been secured from Gates Foundation and  BKES 1.086 is a carryover from previous strategy support (as at January 2017). Sweden is requested to provide BKES 0.48 (MSEK 50).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention has two components namely financial inclusion and trade facilitation. The intended outcome is to generate sustainable improvements in the lives of lower-income people in Kenya through development of a financial and trade system which delivers real value to the low-income people in Kenya. The objectives of this intervention; both financial inclusion and trade facilitation is anchored on working with market players to address three key bariers to inclusion namely i) high cost;ii) insufficient value; and iii) weak trust in the system
While the specific approach to attainment of these objectives of reducing costs, creating value and building trust in both the financial and trade market system relies on building the capacity of the market to work with key areas including: rules of the game which shift incentives in favour of the poor; enhancing efficiencies in the industry infrastructure; and&#xA0; promoting a shared collective vision on development of the financial services sector (FSS). Additionally, trade facilitation for the real economy aims at creating market capacity and incentives to innovate trade solutions which deliver real value for the economy, enterprises and households.
The rationale behind the trade facilitation is that the trade system must evolve in a way that it only allocates value to trading partners in line with the value they have added within the system and by breaking down information asymmetries.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">FSD Kenya&#x2019;s projects are organised into four areas based on the financial market development outcomes outlined in its theory of change. These are: (i) Long-term vision and policy, (ii) Regulation, (iii) Financial infrastructure, and (iv) Innovation. Progress in each area and the crosscutting functions are described below. Projects under long term vision and policy included recent FSDK technical support led to the creation of a new Kenya Government Digital economy strategy blueprint (2019) launched by the Kenyan president and the recognition of Digital Finance as a flagship project highlighting the importance of the financial sector development policy (from 2005) to formally encompass financial access as a policy priority alongside efficiency and stability. A trusted partner of the National Treasury, FSD Kenya has been directly engaged in the development of successive Vision 2030 medium-term plans for the financial services sector. FSD Kenya initiated the first comprehensive market survey on financial inclusion (FinAccess Household Survey report) and supported it to becoming a sustainable part of the government statistical architecture, the study which has become the most valuable financial inclusion tracking instrument is jointly done every three years by FSDK, Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya National Bureau of Statistics . Kenya continues to be considered at the frontier in Africa, particularly given the scale and role of mobile money and fintech in both driving financial inclusion but also creating new areas of concern. Market information built on the success of the FinAccess household survey report 2019 launch garnered support for sustainability and use of FinAccess as well as the potential to complement this with the supply side data intervention. Other several successful events were held highlighting the value of segmentation and how to use data to develop more inclusive financial solutions. Under the Regulatory system development, the interest rate controls introduced in September 2016 were abolished in 2019, which is expected to have a positive impact on credit growth especially with regard to micro and small medium enterprises access to finance, financial integration and tax revenues. Additionally, work on regulation by FSD Kenya helped establish the new enabling regulatory frameworks which have underpinned the expansion of financial inclusion and fintech innovation in Kenya. This has included regulation for deposit-taking microfinance and financial co-operatives, the regulatory response which enabled the emergence of the M-Pesa mobile-money platform, agent banking, electronic payments and the first regulatory sandbox for fintech in Kenya (under the Capital Markets Authority). Under stability, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Sandbox continues to progress well and has inspired a promising conversation at the annual joint financial sector regulators forum about a sector-wide approach to innovation. Competition work has resulted in enhanced disclosure in both digital and non-digital realms. Reflecting Kenya&#x2019;s success in encouraging the development of digital finance, regulators from across the continent and beyond have sought to learn from the Kenya approach facilitated by FSD Kenya in collaboration with the FSD Network. FinAccess Household Survey report 2019 revealed that mobile money users have substantially more challenges than users of regulated financial services like banks and mobile banks, with nearly 30% experiencing loss of money or fraud. Thus, Kenya&#x2019;s financial stability is linked to innovation both in the financial sector and more broadly. The results of this work are clearly evident in the 2019 Financial Access Household Survey, where formal financial inclusion has risen from 26.7% of adults in 2006 to 82.9% in 2019, while complete exclusion of financial access and services has dropped from 41.3% of adults in 2006 to 11.0% in 2019. The informal financial sector declined from 32.1% in 2006 to 6.1% in 2019; the &#x201C;excluded&#x201D; category &#x2013; the &#x201C;unbankable&#x201D; &#x2013; declined from 41.3% in 2006 to 11% in 2019. PWC&#x2019;s Africa Business Agenda 2019 indicated that Kenya is number 1 in Africa in the growth of innovative companies. A key area of focus going forward in Kenya will be to drive for financial stability and market integrity particularly with regards market conduct, while supporting financial innovation that drives inclusive growth. Significant gains have been achieved in improving financial infrastructure. FSD Kenya was involved in the inception of credit information sharing which now encompasses most of the formal financial system although more work is needed as credit markets continue to evolve. So far there are atleast three credit Reference Bureaus ( Credit Reference Bureau Africa Limited, Metropol Credit Reference Bureau limited and Creditinfo Credit Reference Bureau Kenya Ltd) licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya to collect and collate credit information on individuals and businesses from different sources and provide that information upon request mainly by credit providers in the form of a credit report. Support for interoperability in the payments system resulted in the creation of a new proto-national switch by the Kenya Bankers Association which has already resulted in market price improvements. This has for example resulted in scaling up of the interbank money transfer solution (PesaLink), which has moved Kenya further toward a cashless society with more financial inclusivity. FSD Kenya pioneered the use of the financial sector to deliver social protection payments in Kenya through support of the UKAid initiated Hunger Safety Net Programme and used that experience to support the launch of the government&#x2019;s Inua Jamii programme in 2005 now supporting 1.2m low-income beneficiaries. Inua Jamii is owned by the Government and last year 2019 saw the close-out of Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) and the government fully taking charge of the social protection programmes. Payment platforms picked up speed with progress on the National Payments System Strategy, filling key positions at Integrated Payment Services Limited (IPSL) and the Payments Association of Kenya (PAK), and initiating new work on the cash-digital interface. Aside from closing out HSNP, the rest of the Government payments work is progressing well on biometric standard interoperability, support to the Government Digital Payments (GDP) team and the ongoing support to Inua Jamii. Under Innovations, Trade facilitation and Building livelihoods both had strong progress in 2019 while the Financial innovations for the real economy (FIRE) project was on track with existing activities but behind plan on new work. The Trade project which is a public private development partnership with Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI), Export Promotion and Brand Kenya (BrandKe), the technology provider Retail Pay Limited and the agreement partner FSDK, witnessed the full launch of the RetailPay pilot, which is a transparent system to facilitate trade end-to-end and operational support as well as key interventions initiated with consortium partners. Significant activity is underway with the Marsabit graduation pilot. The programme was initiated with the aim of testing market-based approaches to building livelihoods of very poor people; and to develop an understanding of how effectively link graduation support with market development in order to increase income and resilience among very poor households in Marsabit County, Northern Kenya. Initial results from the field monitoring visit to Marsabit (see field vist report) reveal a more positive picture about the impact of the graduation work and call into question whether the project should be closed this year or extended to ensure full sustainability. Generally, Innovation has been a centrepiece of the FSD Kenya programme from the outset and today Kenya is positioned globally as a leading innovator in financial inclusion and fintech. Direct support for the development of the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA)/M-Pesa M-Shwari digital savings and credit solution (25.8m accounts opened since inception) has resulted in highly competitive market for digital finance. This solution has been replicated in many additional markets across Africa and beyond. Investment in establishing a novel shared management services network for 38 financial services associations (village banks) serving 300,000 low-income rural households most with no access to the formal financial service providers (except M-Pesa). FSD Kenya helped created new models to scale-up improved community-based savings groups &#x2013; currently used by over one million poor households in Kenya. This work has been leveraged by other FSDs in Mozambique and Zambia. More recent work has supported experimentation with fintechs working at the intersection of finance and real-economy areas like agriculture and health. FSD Kenya&#x2019;s cross-cutting functions continue to support the programme effectively. Building on the full roll-out of the project data management system, the results function supported the projects to ensure activity is aligned with objectives. Beyond the system, Results also engaged with the FSD Network process of aligning indicators on impact, carried out internal reviews through field visits and facilitated a new cross-project effort to generate case studies on the sustainability of FSD&#x2019;s impact.  FSD Kenya has solidified its position as the go-to source of information on financial inclusion in Kenya. In the third quarter alone of 2019, there were 62 mentions of FSD Kenya&#x2019;s work in the press, 7 blogs published by the team (including one turned into an Op-ed at the request of one of the leading main stream newspapers in Kenya -Daily Nation) and increased social media engagement. According to the World Bank, it has become much easier to do business in Kenya and Kenya&#x2019;s robust digital economy is mentioned as the most significant contributor to this success. In the Bank&apos;s Ease of Doing Business Index, Kenya ranked 61 out of 190 countries in 2019, up from 136 in 2015</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
FN:s WFP och UNICEF har l&#xE4;mnat ett gemensamt programf&#xF6;rslag till Sverige g&#xE4;llande ett st&#xF6;d p&#xE5; totalt 78 MSEK till den kenyanska staten. Syftet &#xE4;r att bygga upp ett system som ger r&#xE4;ttvis tillg&#xE5;ng till sociala skyddssystem och barnskyddssystem.   

Den l&#xE5;ngsiktiga visionen &#xE4;r ett socialt skyddssystem som &#xE4;r integrerat, tar h&#xE4;nsyn till barn och fungerar i n&#xF6;dsituationer, som ger f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;nstagarna tillg&#xE5;ng till ett grundl&#xE4;ggande socialt skydd samt att ett &#xF6;kat antal m&#xE4;n, kvinnor, pojkar och flickor fr&#xE5;n de fattigaste och mest s&#xE5;rbara hush&#xE5;llen f&#xE5;r tillg&#xE5;ng till detta.

F&#xF6;rslaget g&#xE5;r ut p&#xE5; att ge teknisk assistans vid revidering, utveckling och inf&#xF6;rande av lagar, rutiner och strategier g&#xE4;llande socialt skydd och barnskydd, att f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rka system, &#xF6;ka kapaciteten och effektiviteten i de sociala skyddsprogrammen samt st&#xE4;rka koordinationen mellan olika sektioner p&#xE5; nationell och regional niv&#xE5;. Det f&#xF6;reslagna programmet kommer att utg&#xE5; fr&#xE5;n befintliga modeller och fokusera p&#xE5; att koppla kontant&#xF6;verf&#xF6;ringsmottagare till barnskyddstj&#xE4;nster med hj&#xE4;lp av integrerad &#xE4;rendehantering. 
  
Det kommer att vara en insats med tv&#xE5; avtal (ett med WFP och ett med UNICEF). Planen &#xE4;r att bed&#xF6;mningar, revisioner, f&#xE4;ltuppdrag och utv&#xE4;rderingar ska utf&#xF6;ras gemensamt. Sverige har de senaste tre &#xE5;ren arbetat med att st&#xF6;dja sociala skyddssystem i Kenya tillsammans med WFP samt under de 14 senaste &#xE5;ren tillsammans med UNICEF arbetat med socialt skydd, barnskydd och utveckling och genomf&#xF6;rande av olika sorters sociala skyddsmekanismer.  

Det nuvarande f&#xF6;rslaget &#xE4;r 78 MSEK under tre &#xE5;r, f&#xF6;rdelade enligt f&#xF6;ljande &#x2013; UNICEF 66 MSEK och WFP 34 MSEK.  Eftersom det inte bildats n&#xE5;gon ny regering i Sverige efter valet och bist&#xE5;ndsbudgeten f&#xF6;r 2019 &#xE4;nnu inte &#xE4;r beslutad kommer ambassaden att teckna ett&#xE5;riga avtal p&#xE5; totalt 40 MSEK med UNICEF (30 MSEK) och WFP (10 MSEK) f&#xF6;r 2018.  Om den nya regeringen ansl&#xE5;r mer medel kan Sverige besluta att avs&#xE4;tta mer medel och f&#xF6;rl&#xE4;nga aktivitetsperioden.</narrative>

Support to UNICEF/WFP Social Protection in Kenya

UN WFP and UNICEF have submitted a joint programme proposal to Sweden for support to the Government of Kenya to provide assistance towards equitable access to social and child protection for a total of 78 MSEK.   

The long-term vision for change is an integrated, child-sensitive and shock-responsive social protection system that links beneficiaries to basic social services, so as to benefit an increased number of men, women, boys and girls; from the poorest and most vulnerable households.   

The proposal aims at 
i) Support Technical Assistance to review, develop and implement legislation, processes and strategies on Social Protection(SP) and Child Protection (CP), systems    strengthening, 
ii) Enhanced capacity and increased efficiencies in the delivery of social protection programmes and to
iii)  strengthen intersectoral coordination linkages at the national and county level. 

The proposed programme will use already existing models and focus on linking cash transfers beneficiaries to child protection services through integrated case management.   

There will be one contribution with two agreements (one with WFP and another with UNICEF).  It is expected that the appraisal, reviews, field missions and evaluations will be conducted jointly.  SE in Kenya has worked previously with support to social protection via both WFP over the last 3 years and UNICEF to both social and child protection over the last 14 years in the development and implementation of different aspects of social protection.  

The current  assessment is for 78MSEK for 3 years distributed as follows - UNICEF 66MSEK and WFP 34MSEK.  However, due to the fact that currently there is no government formed in Sweden and the aid budget for 2019 is not yet decided, the Embassy will sign with both UNICEF and WFP a one year agreement in 2018 for a total of 40 MSEK - 30MSEK for UNICEF and 10MSEK for WFP.  However, should funds be available after the government appropriation, Sweden can then take a decision to avail more funds and prolong the activity period.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed programme has an overall goal to ensure that people in Kenya, especially the most vulnerable groups, live in dignity, are free from poverty, hunger, violence, abuse and exploitation, to be able to exploit their full human capabilities and contribute to the national development.
The original assessment of the objectives and contribution&apos;s theory of change still stands&#xA0;save for the current Covid-19 pandemic which has brought in positive aspects of testing the shock-responsiveness of the Social Protection system in Kenya and how to enhance the system to&#xA0;address varying types of shocks which will affect Kenya&#xA0;in future.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Social Protection Government of Kenya (GoK) is gradually shifting towards universal approaches in social protection and UNICEF and WFP are strongly supporting this agenda with technical, financial, and advocacy support. The introduction of a Universal Child Benefit (UCB) in Kenya is a key goal, stated in both the revised policy and the investment plan, and will be a breakthrough for the sector and for the wellbeing of children in Kenya. UNICEF and WFP provided technical and financial support to Ministry of Labour and Social Protection (MLSP) to develop three key strategic documents for the social protection sector. These are an overarching Social Protection Policy, a 10-year Investment Plan and a 5-year Social Protection Strategy. These documents are expected to work synergistically and provide a blueprint to expand and strengthen the sector in the next years The Government of Kenya has developed regulations for the establishment of a Social Assistance Fund within the Public Finance Management Act (2012), with financial and technical support from WFP and UNICEF. Regulations were drafted in August 2019 by a taskforce led by the National Treasury and then tabled before Parliament for a first reading of the Social Assistance Bill 2020. The establishment of a Social Assistance Fund will be a major milestone for the social protection sector in Kenya in terms of enabling enhanced coverage and provision of timely, predictable and adequate benefits to beneficiaries, as well as clear grievances and case management mechanisms The Baseline Survey Report of Kenya&#x2019;s Inua Jamii 70 Years and Above Cash Transfer Programme was developed by the Government of Kenya with technical and financial support of ILO, UNICEF and WFP, and officially launched on 1st October 2020 on the International Day of Older Persons. This baseline report provides a vital reference point for future impact evaluations of universal pensions and their subsequent effects on human well-being, including poverty alleviation, food and nutrition security Under the overall leadership of WFP, the two partners supported the continued development and enhancement of existing Management Information Systems (MISs), e.g. to accommodate cash plus and shock-responsive models within the framework of the National Safety Net Programme. At the same time, UNICEF and WFP continued to support the strengthening and expansion of the Single Registry, making sure all existing Social Protection MISs are linked to the registry, including linkages to complementary social protection programmes through data-sharing mechanisms. This allows county governments, non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, and other partners who provide complementary services to existing Inua Jamii beneficiaries and other social protection interventions to share data and information for enhanced coordination and integration. UNICEF continued to support the development of an evaluation plan and a set of tailored monitoring tools for monthly, quarterly and annual reporting on the Social Protection sector. The Kenya Social Protection M&amp;amp;E Framework 2018-2022 was initially developed in 2018 based on the 2011 Policy, and it has been updated to align it with the policy as revised in 2019 WFP and UNICEF supported the MLSP to develop, institutionalize and roll out a Learning and Development Curriculum for Social Protection. The curriculum was based on the most critical capacity development needs of the national and county governments as identified by MLSP. In the area of disability-inclusive Social Protection, UNICEF supported three Government Officers to participate in a short-course of University Bonn as part of the UNPRPD-ILO-UNICEF Inclusive Social Protection Initiative, which was conducted from June to November 2020. During the reporting period, WFP and UNICEF initiated a partnership with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) to coordinate and support activities linking health and social protection and ultimately aim at mainstreaming NHIF membership into the National Safety Net Programme Child Protection UNICEF continued to work with National Council on Administration of Justice (NCAJ)- Special Taskforce on Children Matters and the National Council for Children Services to advocate for the Children Bill to advance &#xA0;through the various stages of the legislative process to ensure its speedy &#xA0;enactment by parliament. The Bill is currently with the Cabinet. In 2020, UNICEF supported the government to complete three important studies that will inform the policy and programme decisions for strengthening child protection systems and services. The 2018 Census on Street Families and the 2019 Survey on Violence against children were completed and launched by Cabinet Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. The Survey was launched together with the National Prevention and Response Plan to address Violence against Children (VaC). On birth registration, UNICEF supported the Civil Registration Services (CRS) to establish a multi-sectoral technical working group which includes all UN agencies supporting with birth registration and also to facilitate with access to virtual platform (zoom-link) to conduct regular meetings On improved access to justice for children, UNICEF planned to support some of the &#x2018;Big 7&#x2019; recommendations highlighted in the Status Report on Children in the Justice System (2019) which UNICEF had provided financial support for its preparation by national Council on Administration of Justice (NCAJ)-Special Taskforce on Children Matters. This was however was not possible with the onset of COVID-19. However, towards the end of 2020, when the situation normalized, UNICEF supported the NCAJ by seconding a child protection officer (National UN Volunteer) to support in the implementation of the Big 7 recommendations. UNICEF is supporting cash plus approaches in three key areas: maternal, newborn and child health (MCNH), nutrition, and energy. Moreover, an additional cash plus pilot currently under design in Mombasa includes a strong focus on disability-inclusive education, alongside a MNCH component. &#xA0;As part of the Covid-19 response, UNICEF Child and Social Protection sections initiated a joint, integrated activity to support children released from residential institutions (both statutory and charitable institution) after their partial closure due to Covid-19 At the same time, the first pilot phase of the Cash Plus Energy programme Mwangaza Mashinani in Garissa and Kilifi counties was successfully concluded, with the last payments going out in July 2020, despite the challenges posed by Covid-19. UNICEF and WFP supported GoK to establish a Technical Working Group (TWG) and a National Steering Committee at national level that include all relevant social protection stakeholders. Moreover, in June 2020, UNICEF and WFP founded the Sectoral Group for Social Protection (SGSP) to gather development partners working in the sector in Kenya. The Sectoral Group aims to ensure that development partners in the social protection sector provide support to the government in a predictable and coordinated manner that aligns with the latter&#x2019;s strategic development priorities. UNICEF and WFP supported GoK in establishing a Community of Practice (CoP) for Social Protection. Led by the Directorate for Social Protection, the CoP was launched in October 2020 with a high-level event (held virtually, with few government representatives participating in person) and has hosted two webinars so far (Social Protection Adaptations to COVID-19; Launch of the Kenya Social Protection M&amp;amp;E Framework), with a third one being planned at the moment. Social Protection and Child Protection Response to Covid-19 Activities during the reporting period were deeply affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and the resulting movement restrictions. USD 733,293 of UNICEF&#x2019;s funds from this grant were reprogrammed towards the Covid-19 response and are being used to support the upcoming UCB pilot. Similarly, WFP launched an emergency cash assistance programme for urban vulnerable groups in Mombasa and Nairobi where each targeted household received KES. 4000 per month for a period of three and four months respectively (the cash transfer funds were from USAID and Finland but with the use the system supported by Sida funds). To improve on the national system within the context of a complex emergency, &#xA0;USD 53,000 of this grant was set aside to facilitate an assessment that seeks to explore the social and economic impacts of COVID and how the existing social protection system has enhanced resilience at household level. The findings of this study will be disseminated in high level advocacy events with policy makers. Overall, to support effective coordination and appropriate response to the affected communities, WFP developed an Application Programming Interface (API) for the Enhanced Single Registry (ESR). This system provides an interface that allows a program to communicate with other programs, running in the same environment. Accordingly, different agencies and institutions with long-term and emergency specific social assistance interventions are able to link and use the ESR which in turn enhances greater collaboration among partners, effective use of available resources, increases transparency while supporting appropriate decision making based on available data. Building on government social and child protection systems, UNICEF is targeting families with children returned home from Charitable Children&#x2019;s Institutions (CCIs) and Statutory Children&#x2019;s Institutions (SCIs) during the Covid-19 outbreak in Garissa, Kilifi, Kisumu Nairobi and Turkana. The intervention, developed and implemented in close collaboration with MLSP at national and county level, provides a monthly cash transfer of Kes 2,000 for six months to support these families, using the existing government mechanism within MLSP, including identification and registration mechanism, as well as NSNP transfer value, payment cycles and payment modalities. Some tweaks to NSNP system were implemented to cater for the emergency nature of the intervention (e.g. the transfer value was adjusted to KES 2000 per child in for the first three months and reverted to the NSNP rate of KES 2000 per household for the remaining 3 months; use of M-Pesa as payment modality instead of banks; use of Kobo tools and Child Protection Information System (CPIMS) to register children and caregivers; support from social workers in the institutions. In light of Covid-19, the urgent need for support of children and adolescents in street situations became more evident. As a result, UNICEF is currently commissioning a study to assess the situation and needs of children and adolescents in street situations to hence design of a tailored social and child protection emergency intervention to support children and adolescent in street situations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic with cash and an ad-hoc package of services Within the framework of the activities to introduce a long-term nation-wide Universal Child Benefit (UCB), UNICEF and WFP, in close collaboration with MSLP, analyzed the possibility of introducing a temporary UCB to cushion vulnerable households during Covid-19. This is in line with the global surge of interest towards social protection, and particularly universal or quasi-universal approaches, as a tool to not only address long-term vulnerabilities but also protect people during crises. A concept note on the rationale for the roll-out of a temporary UCB was developed through intense discussion with the government and other UN agencies in mid-2020, and UNICEF and WFP are now working on the design and preparatory activities for the roll-out a pilot UCB in selected areas During the onset of COVID-19 and the crisis that followed the containment measures, the child protection was unfortunately not classified as one of the essential services by government. All officers from Department of Children services and National Council of Children Services worked from home. UNICEF supported both NCCS and Department of Children Services (DCS) to coordinate partners to continue supporting required services as well as emerging concerns from COVID-19 situation. UNICEF supported the development and provision of virtual training to 450 children officers and staff from NGOs through a series of 12 webinars. The trainings focused on child protection and mental health and psychosocial effects of COVID-19 on children, parents and their communities and required response. UNICEF provided financial and technical support to increase the number of telephone counsellors at the child helpline 116 services from 15 to 30 counsellors, configured the child line laptops for remote access and procured additional 8 laptops to improve the performance of Childline during the Covid-19 period. The staff at child helpline were provided with virtual training related to facts about Covid-19, related messages, referral service points and sensitized on mental health and psychosocial support during the Covid-19 period. &#xA0;Overall, between January and December 2020, a total of 92,672 (46,245 girls, 44,465 boys and 1,962 gender undisclosed) children, parents and caregivers were reached with mental health and psychosocial support services across Kenya with various UNICEF supported interventions including the CPVs support, child helpline and support within the &#xA0;Kakuma and Dadaab Refugee Camps. SIDA funds were also used to procure some personal protective equipment (PPE) that were distributed to CCIs and SCIs that requested for support through the MLSP, to NGOs working in the refugee camps and also to officers of Civil Registration Officers who had to continue with issuance of birth certificates. The PPEs included water jerricans, soap, and masks.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">FN:s WFP och UNICEF har l&#xE4;mnat ett gemensamt programf&#xF6;rslag till Sverige g&#xE4;llande ett st&#xF6;d p&#xE5; totalt 78 MSEK till den kenyanska staten. Syftet &#xE4;r att bygga upp ett system som ger r&#xE4;ttvis tillg&#xE5;ng till sociala skyddssystem och barnskyddssystem.   

Den l&#xE5;ngsiktiga visionen &#xE4;r ett socialt skyddssystem som &#xE4;r integrerat, tar h&#xE4;nsyn till barn och fungerar i n&#xF6;dsituationer, som ger f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;nstagarna tillg&#xE5;ng till ett grundl&#xE4;ggande socialt skydd samt att ett &#xF6;kat antal m&#xE4;n, kvinnor, pojkar och flickor fr&#xE5;n de fattigaste och mest s&#xE5;rbara hush&#xE5;llen f&#xE5;r tillg&#xE5;ng till detta.

F&#xF6;rslaget g&#xE5;r ut p&#xE5; att ge teknisk assistans vid revidering, utveckling och inf&#xF6;rande av lagar, rutiner och strategier g&#xE4;llande socialt skydd och barnskydd, att f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rka system, &#xF6;ka kapaciteten och effektiviteten i de sociala skyddsprogrammen samt st&#xE4;rka koordinationen mellan olika sektioner p&#xE5; nationell och regional niv&#xE5;. Det f&#xF6;reslagna programmet kommer att utg&#xE5; fr&#xE5;n befintliga modeller och fokusera p&#xE5; att koppla kontant&#xF6;verf&#xF6;ringsmottagare till barnskyddstj&#xE4;nster med hj&#xE4;lp av integrerad &#xE4;rendehantering. 
  
Det kommer att vara en insats med tv&#xE5; avtal (ett med WFP och ett med UNICEF). Planen &#xE4;r att bed&#xF6;mningar, revisioner, f&#xE4;ltuppdrag och utv&#xE4;rderingar ska utf&#xF6;ras gemensamt. Sverige har de senaste tre &#xE5;ren arbetat med att st&#xF6;dja sociala skyddssystem i Kenya tillsammans med WFP samt under de 14 senaste &#xE5;ren tillsammans med UNICEF arbetat med socialt skydd, barnskydd och utveckling och genomf&#xF6;rande av olika sorters sociala skyddsmekanismer.  

Det nuvarande f&#xF6;rslaget &#xE4;r 78 MSEK under tre &#xE5;r, f&#xF6;rdelade enligt f&#xF6;ljande &#x2013; UNICEF 66 MSEK och WFP 34 MSEK.  Eftersom det inte bildats n&#xE5;gon ny regering i Sverige efter valet och bist&#xE5;ndsbudgeten f&#xF6;r 2019 &#xE4;nnu inte &#xE4;r beslutad kommer ambassaden att teckna ett&#xE5;riga avtal p&#xE5; totalt 40 MSEK med UNICEF (30 MSEK) och WFP (10 MSEK) f&#xF6;r 2018.  Om den nya regeringen ansl&#xE5;r mer medel kan Sverige besluta att avs&#xE4;tta mer medel och f&#xF6;rl&#xE4;nga aktivitetsperioden.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to UNICEF/WFP Social Protection in Kenya

UN WFP and UNICEF have submitted a joint programme proposal to Sweden for support to the Government of Kenya to provide assistance towards equitable access to social and child protection for a total of 78 MSEK.   

The long-term vision for change is an integrated, child-sensitive and shock-responsive social protection system that links beneficiaries to basic social services, so as to benefit an increased number of men, women, boys and girls; from the poorest and most vulnerable households.   

The proposal aims at 
i) Support Technical Assistance to review, develop and implement legislation, processes and strategies on Social Protection(SP) and Child Protection (CP), systems    strengthening, 
ii) Enhanced capacity and increased efficiencies in the delivery of social protection programmes and to
iii)  strengthen intersectoral coordination linkages at the national and county level. 

The proposed programme will use already existing models and focus on linking cash transfers beneficiaries to child protection services through integrated case management.   

There will be one contribution with two agreements (one with WFP and another with UNICEF).  It is expected that the appraisal, reviews, field missions and evaluations will be conducted jointly.  SE in Kenya has worked previously with support to social protection via both WFP over the last 3 years and UNICEF to both social and child protection over the last 14 years in the development and implementation of different aspects of social protection.  

The current  assessment is for 78MSEK for 3 years distributed as follows - UNICEF 66MSEK and WFP 34MSEK.  However, due to the fact that currently there is no government formed in Sweden and the aid budget for 2019 is not yet decided, the Embassy will sign with both UNICEF and WFP a one year agreement in 2018 for a total of 40 MSEK - 30MSEK for UNICEF and 10MSEK for WFP.  However, should funds be available after the government appropriation, Sweden can then take a decision to avail more funds and prolong the activity period.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed programme has an overall goal to ensure that people in Kenya, especially the most vulnerable groups, live in dignity, are free from poverty, hunger, violence, abuse and exploitation, to be able to exploit their full human capabilities and contribute to the national development.
The original assessment of the objectives and contribution&apos;s theory of change still stands&#xA0;save for the current Covid-19 pandemic which has brought in positive aspects of testing the shock-responsiveness of the Social Protection system in Kenya and how to enhance the system to&#xA0;address varying types of shocks which will affect Kenya&#xA0;in future.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Social Protection Government of Kenya (GoK) is gradually shifting towards universal approaches in social protection and UNICEF and WFP are strongly supporting this agenda with technical, financial, and advocacy support. The introduction of a Universal Child Benefit (UCB) in Kenya is a key goal, stated in both the revised policy and the investment plan, and will be a breakthrough for the sector and for the wellbeing of children in Kenya. UNICEF and WFP provided technical and financial support to Ministry of Labour and Social Protection (MLSP) to develop three key strategic documents for the social protection sector. These are an overarching Social Protection Policy, a 10-year Investment Plan and a 5-year Social Protection Strategy. These documents are expected to work synergistically and provide a blueprint to expand and strengthen the sector in the next years The Government of Kenya has developed regulations for the establishment of a Social Assistance Fund within the Public Finance Management Act (2012), with financial and technical support from WFP and UNICEF. Regulations were drafted in August 2019 by a taskforce led by the National Treasury and then tabled before Parliament for a first reading of the Social Assistance Bill 2020. The establishment of a Social Assistance Fund will be a major milestone for the social protection sector in Kenya in terms of enabling enhanced coverage and provision of timely, predictable and adequate benefits to beneficiaries, as well as clear grievances and case management mechanisms The Baseline Survey Report of Kenya&#x2019;s Inua Jamii 70 Years and Above Cash Transfer Programme was developed by the Government of Kenya with technical and financial support of ILO, UNICEF and WFP, and officially launched on 1st October 2020 on the International Day of Older Persons. This baseline report provides a vital reference point for future impact evaluations of universal pensions and their subsequent effects on human well-being, including poverty alleviation, food and nutrition security Under the overall leadership of WFP, the two partners supported the continued development and enhancement of existing Management Information Systems (MISs), e.g. to accommodate cash plus and shock-responsive models within the framework of the National Safety Net Programme. At the same time, UNICEF and WFP continued to support the strengthening and expansion of the Single Registry, making sure all existing Social Protection MISs are linked to the registry, including linkages to complementary social protection programmes through data-sharing mechanisms. This allows county governments, non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, and other partners who provide complementary services to existing Inua Jamii beneficiaries and other social protection interventions to share data and information for enhanced coordination and integration. UNICEF continued to support the development of an evaluation plan and a set of tailored monitoring tools for monthly, quarterly and annual reporting on the Social Protection sector. The Kenya Social Protection M&amp;amp;E Framework 2018-2022 was initially developed in 2018 based on the 2011 Policy, and it has been updated to align it with the policy as revised in 2019 WFP and UNICEF supported the MLSP to develop, institutionalize and roll out a Learning and Development Curriculum for Social Protection. The curriculum was based on the most critical capacity development needs of the national and county governments as identified by MLSP. In the area of disability-inclusive Social Protection, UNICEF supported three Government Officers to participate in a short-course of University Bonn as part of the UNPRPD-ILO-UNICEF Inclusive Social Protection Initiative, which was conducted from June to November 2020. During the reporting period, WFP and UNICEF initiated a partnership with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) to coordinate and support activities linking health and social protection and ultimately aim at mainstreaming NHIF membership into the National Safety Net Programme Child Protection UNICEF continued to work with National Council on Administration of Justice (NCAJ)- Special Taskforce on Children Matters and the National Council for Children Services to advocate for the Children Bill to advance &#xA0;through the various stages of the legislative process to ensure its speedy &#xA0;enactment by parliament. The Bill is currently with the Cabinet. In 2020, UNICEF supported the government to complete three important studies that will inform the policy and programme decisions for strengthening child protection systems and services. The 2018 Census on Street Families and the 2019 Survey on Violence against children were completed and launched by Cabinet Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection. The Survey was launched together with the National Prevention and Response Plan to address Violence against Children (VaC). On birth registration, UNICEF supported the Civil Registration Services (CRS) to establish a multi-sectoral technical working group which includes all UN agencies supporting with birth registration and also to facilitate with access to virtual platform (zoom-link) to conduct regular meetings On improved access to justice for children, UNICEF planned to support some of the &#x2018;Big 7&#x2019; recommendations highlighted in the Status Report on Children in the Justice System (2019) which UNICEF had provided financial support for its preparation by national Council on Administration of Justice (NCAJ)-Special Taskforce on Children Matters. This was however was not possible with the onset of COVID-19. However, towards the end of 2020, when the situation normalized, UNICEF supported the NCAJ by seconding a child protection officer (National UN Volunteer) to support in the implementation of the Big 7 recommendations. UNICEF is supporting cash plus approaches in three key areas: maternal, newborn and child health (MCNH), nutrition, and energy. Moreover, an additional cash plus pilot currently under design in Mombasa includes a strong focus on disability-inclusive education, alongside a MNCH component. &#xA0;As part of the Covid-19 response, UNICEF Child and Social Protection sections initiated a joint, integrated activity to support children released from residential institutions (both statutory and charitable institution) after their partial closure due to Covid-19 At the same time, the first pilot phase of the Cash Plus Energy programme Mwangaza Mashinani in Garissa and Kilifi counties was successfully concluded, with the last payments going out in July 2020, despite the challenges posed by Covid-19. UNICEF and WFP supported GoK to establish a Technical Working Group (TWG) and a National Steering Committee at national level that include all relevant social protection stakeholders. Moreover, in June 2020, UNICEF and WFP founded the Sectoral Group for Social Protection (SGSP) to gather development partners working in the sector in Kenya. The Sectoral Group aims to ensure that development partners in the social protection sector provide support to the government in a predictable and coordinated manner that aligns with the latter&#x2019;s strategic development priorities. UNICEF and WFP supported GoK in establishing a Community of Practice (CoP) for Social Protection. Led by the Directorate for Social Protection, the CoP was launched in October 2020 with a high-level event (held virtually, with few government representatives participating in person) and has hosted two webinars so far (Social Protection Adaptations to COVID-19; Launch of the Kenya Social Protection M&amp;amp;E Framework), with a third one being planned at the moment. Social Protection and Child Protection Response to Covid-19 Activities during the reporting period were deeply affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and the resulting movement restrictions. USD 733,293 of UNICEF&#x2019;s funds from this grant were reprogrammed towards the Covid-19 response and are being used to support the upcoming UCB pilot. Similarly, WFP launched an emergency cash assistance programme for urban vulnerable groups in Mombasa and Nairobi where each targeted household received KES. 4000 per month for a period of three and four months respectively (the cash transfer funds were from USAID and Finland but with the use the system supported by Sida funds). To improve on the national system within the context of a complex emergency, &#xA0;USD 53,000 of this grant was set aside to facilitate an assessment that seeks to explore the social and economic impacts of COVID and how the existing social protection system has enhanced resilience at household level. The findings of this study will be disseminated in high level advocacy events with policy makers. Overall, to support effective coordination and appropriate response to the affected communities, WFP developed an Application Programming Interface (API) for the Enhanced Single Registry (ESR). This system provides an interface that allows a program to communicate with other programs, running in the same environment. Accordingly, different agencies and institutions with long-term and emergency specific social assistance interventions are able to link and use the ESR which in turn enhances greater collaboration among partners, effective use of available resources, increases transparency while supporting appropriate decision making based on available data. Building on government social and child protection systems, UNICEF is targeting families with children returned home from Charitable Children&#x2019;s Institutions (CCIs) and Statutory Children&#x2019;s Institutions (SCIs) during the Covid-19 outbreak in Garissa, Kilifi, Kisumu Nairobi and Turkana. The intervention, developed and implemented in close collaboration with MLSP at national and county level, provides a monthly cash transfer of Kes 2,000 for six months to support these families, using the existing government mechanism within MLSP, including identification and registration mechanism, as well as NSNP transfer value, payment cycles and payment modalities. Some tweaks to NSNP system were implemented to cater for the emergency nature of the intervention (e.g. the transfer value was adjusted to KES 2000 per child in for the first three months and reverted to the NSNP rate of KES 2000 per household for the remaining 3 months; use of M-Pesa as payment modality instead of banks; use of Kobo tools and Child Protection Information System (CPIMS) to register children and caregivers; support from social workers in the institutions. In light of Covid-19, the urgent need for support of children and adolescents in street situations became more evident. As a result, UNICEF is currently commissioning a study to assess the situation and needs of children and adolescents in street situations to hence design of a tailored social and child protection emergency intervention to support children and adolescent in street situations in light of the Covid-19 pandemic with cash and an ad-hoc package of services Within the framework of the activities to introduce a long-term nation-wide Universal Child Benefit (UCB), UNICEF and WFP, in close collaboration with MSLP, analyzed the possibility of introducing a temporary UCB to cushion vulnerable households during Covid-19. This is in line with the global surge of interest towards social protection, and particularly universal or quasi-universal approaches, as a tool to not only address long-term vulnerabilities but also protect people during crises. A concept note on the rationale for the roll-out of a temporary UCB was developed through intense discussion with the government and other UN agencies in mid-2020, and UNICEF and WFP are now working on the design and preparatory activities for the roll-out a pilot UCB in selected areas During the onset of COVID-19 and the crisis that followed the containment measures, the child protection was unfortunately not classified as one of the essential services by government. All officers from Department of Children services and National Council of Children Services worked from home. UNICEF supported both NCCS and Department of Children Services (DCS) to coordinate partners to continue supporting required services as well as emerging concerns from COVID-19 situation. UNICEF supported the development and provision of virtual training to 450 children officers and staff from NGOs through a series of 12 webinars. The trainings focused on child protection and mental health and psychosocial effects of COVID-19 on children, parents and their communities and required response. UNICEF provided financial and technical support to increase the number of telephone counsellors at the child helpline 116 services from 15 to 30 counsellors, configured the child line laptops for remote access and procured additional 8 laptops to improve the performance of Childline during the Covid-19 period. The staff at child helpline were provided with virtual training related to facts about Covid-19, related messages, referral service points and sensitized on mental health and psychosocial support during the Covid-19 period. &#xA0;Overall, between January and December 2020, a total of 92,672 (46,245 girls, 44,465 boys and 1,962 gender undisclosed) children, parents and caregivers were reached with mental health and psychosocial support services across Kenya with various UNICEF supported interventions including the CPVs support, child helpline and support within the &#xA0;Kakuma and Dadaab Refugee Camps. SIDA funds were also used to procure some personal protective equipment (PPE) that were distributed to CCIs and SCIs that requested for support through the MLSP, to NGOs working in the refugee camps and also to officers of Civil Registration Officers who had to continue with issuance of birth certificates. The PPEs included water jerricans, soap, and masks.</narrative>
