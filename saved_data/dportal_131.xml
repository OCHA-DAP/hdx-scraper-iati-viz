   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livelihood Inclusion of Vulnerable-COVID-19-affected-Communities with Emphasis upon Women Engagement (LIVE) in Chaghai</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The people of Balochistan are faced with multiple crisis in the recent past. The level of vulnerabilities exacerbated with recurrent drought spells, specifically the last spell between 2007-2019 (1.79 Million Affectees) added serious and irreversible damages to the livelihood patterns of inhabitants. Moreover, above normal rainfall and snowfall throughout 2019-20 turned into flash flooding and snow emergency (1.1 Million Affectees) resultantly marked 48% rural population in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and 4 (emergency). The district of Chaghai is among the worst affected list where around 65% of district population were labelled in phase 3 or above of IPC exercise in 2019. The situation should have compounded with COVID outbreak and Locust attack. The socio-economic impact of COVID-19 are much more significant than its health adversaries COVID will push additional 2.5 million people food insecure in the country by the end of this year. 
District Chaghai is the largest and most sparsely populated district of Pakistan, the level of vulnerabilities for the district are even the highest among the districts of Balochistan. Chaghai became the limelight of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan right from the beginning since religious pilgrims from Iran were suspected to be the first victims and/or carriers of Corona in Pakistan. The restrictions imposed during the pandemic have not only increased the cost of living, as well as travelling restrictions aggravate the hardships of the working community with restricted work opportunities. 
IR has conducted a remotely monitored rapid need assessment exercise within its targeted communities during the Pandemic (July 2020. The finding of the exercise in district Chaghai did validate that the menace of the pandemic and its consequences on socio-economic sectors are as harsh as that of the country. The income level have been reduced more than 50% while the efficacy of service delivery has been curtailed to a large extent. Two third of the respondents (71%) share that their livelihood sources have been severely impaired due to the lockdown. 10% respondents that their resources for 50 to 100% have been affected and now that are out of options to earn a living a spend a life upright
IR is targeting Rabi planting season in district Chaghai as well as emphasizing on the protection of livelihood assets. The proposed module is more align with the strategic priorities of Agriculture and Food Security Working group, formally endorsed from the Agriculture line Departments and more importantly in line with the Response Strategy of Islamic Relief against COVID-19. The proposed interventions within the agriculture and livestock sectors (crops support, capacity building session in both agriculture and livestock sectors, restocking of poultry birds and ruminants, veterinary services, and cash grants for service providers in value chain) are estimated to reach 16,925 individuals in district Chaghai, including 5585 men, 5247 women, 3050 boys, 3043 girls and 677 disable persons as targeted direct beneficiaries. The need identification survey and consultation with line departments confirm 5 Union Councils (Barabcha, Chilghazi, Pat Gwanako, Ziarat Balnosh, and Amuri) for effective targeting. Within these Union Councils, population residing along border areas have peculiar needs and vulnerabilities owing to intensified restrictions in terms of livelihood opportunities due to border closures and security concerns. Though the specific outputs of the project are humanitarian in nature  , the outcome drawn are convincingly provide an enabling environment for long lasting impacts. The interventions proposed are evolving around sustainable livelihood options keeping in mind &#x2018;do no harm&#x2019; principles and SPHERE standards. Moreover, 2080 afghan refugees will be targeted for necessary agriculture and livestock interventions to complement their food security needs from household sources and augment their nutritional needs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash for Work Assistance to COVID-19 Affected Vulnerable Population in district Chaghi.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 pandemic has further added to the complexity of the humanitarian situation existing in district Chaghi due to drought, floods, locust swarms and long existing multidimensional chronic poverty. District Chaghi continues holding bottom ranks on human development index.  Balochistan DNS 2019  reported that in district chaghi 74% of the households were moderately or severely food insecure whereas 22% were severely food insecure. 

Agriculture, which is the mainstay of the district&#x2019;s economy had been adversely impacted by the drought. Unavailability of agricultural inputs, lack of manpower, financial constraints and unavailability of seeds, loss/lack of draught animals further aggravate the situation. Livelihood of a significant number of people in chaghi also depends on cross border trade with Afghanistan recent fencing on the border between the two countries has also disrupted the livelihoods of the hundreds of people involved in this economic activity.  

Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the livelihood of all socioeconomic groups in the district hardest hit are the daily wage earners, small-scale men/women farmers and agriculture labor dependent on sustenance agriculture, in both Afghan refugee and the host communities in the area. 
These vulnerable groups have limited capacity to purchase food. It is feared that the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the adoption of the negative coping strategies, such as limiting dietary intake and diversification, distress sale of productive assets and seed stocks and borrowing at exorbitant mark-ups in order to meet their household food and non-food needs. Immediate assistance to acquire life sustaining food can be the difference between life and death for a great number of people surviving the situation so far.

The proposed intervention will address the immediate life sustaining food/nutritional needs of the most vulnerable people both in Afghan refugees and host communities in UCs through CBT both unconditional and in exchange for work and trainings depending on whether the concerned beneficiaries are unable or able to participate in work/training. Inability to participate in work/training could be on the grounds of age, disability, illness and pregnancy/child care related issues. Community&#x2019;s resilience will also be built in their fight against COVID-19 by providing them necessary information, equipment and supplies to follow SOPs for prevention and protection.  The proposed target UCs are selected using FS VAM  exercise results and are in line with its priority one. 
Afghan refugee communities in the area are organized in three revenue villages (RV) namely RV chaghi, RV Posti, and RV Ljy karaze with a total population of 57159. TF proposes to select 200 beneficiary HHs from each of the three RVs (a total of 600 households benefiting 4&#x2019;560 individuals) the selection will be done in close coordination with the target RVs and UNHCR. 

70 households (525 persons), will benefit from unconditional cash transfer
1440 household (10&#x2019;800 persons) will participate in cash for work.
77 physical infrastructure schemes will be constructed/rehabilitated, out of which
10 will be of drinking water and the rest of the 67 schemes of irrigation and flood protection schemes.
1210 women will participate in training programs on kitchen gardening, food safety nutrition, COVID-19 prevention and TF&#x2019;s accountability mechanism).
90 VDCs M/Fmembers&#x2019; orientation/training on protection, GBV, COVID 19 risk reduction measures.
600 Refugee H/Hs will receive poultry bird kits and FFS support regarding poultry management, production, breeding and poultry disease control to increase household protein production. 
Inclusivity, protection and gender equality/women empowerment will be central focus of all the interventions in this project. TF will closely coordinate with PDMA, DDMA, local authorities, UNHCR, UN Food WASH, Livelihoods clusters UNOCHA and other working in the area.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving the food security, nutrition and livelihoods of vulnerable households affected by the COVID-19.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project supplements and strengthens Government of Pakistan and Balochistan&#x2019;s effort for the fight against COVID-19 through the provision of livelihood support and increasing the food security of vulnerable HHs in three districts of Balochistan. The overall objective of the project is to assist the poor households in improving their overall food security, nutritional status and livelihoods of vulnerable households in five (05) most vulnerable Union Councils (UCs) three (03) most affected districts i.e. Pishin, Jhal Magsi and Washuk of Balochistan province. The target UCs include 1. Kazha Viala 2. Narain (tehsil Barshor, district Pishin) 3. Hathyari 4. Jhal Magsi (of tehsil and district Jhal Magsi) 5. Palantak (tehsil and district Washuk)  The selected UCs for the proposed project had been identified as priority UCs under Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) for Food Security Analysis. While, the proposed interventions such as the provision of cash grants, crop production support to the small farmers and provision of livestock assets are also aligned with the food security cluster&#x2019;s priorities for this grant. The emergency livelihood restoration support planned under this project include: 

- 1,680 Ultra and Vulnerable Poor households identified and selected for the planned support:
This activity will provide the basis for the distribution of planned packages to the vulnerable households in VAM prioritised target UCs. For the identification and selection purpose, the poverty scorecard (PSC) data will be used. This data has been collected under an EU funded on-going programme by applying recognised poverty scorecard tool, which is widely used for the household targeting purpose for livelihood and social safety net programmes. However, to further validate and ensure the identification of target households FGDs will be held in the villages of target UC and BRSP fostered community institutions will be engaged for the endorsement of selected beneficiaries for the following packages.

a. 700 Ultra and Vulnerable Poor HHs provided with Unconditional Cash Grants:
This activity will primarily focus on the women, persons with disability (PWD), child-headed households and/or the households with unemployed head.

b. 280 Agriculture farmers provided with Crops Production Support. 
This activity will focus the small agriculture farmers with cultivable lands up to 5-6 acres, whose livelihood activities have been affected by the recent pandemic and/or disasters such as drought, heavy rains and flash-floods.

c. 700 Smallholder livestock farmers are provided with Livestock assets/other support 
This support is planned for the smallholder livestock farmers or households with the capacity to manage livestock. This will be a women-focused activity, as in rural settings usually, women are responsible to manage this activity. 

Besides, the provision of livelihood support to the vulnerable HHs the proposed project also integrates to reaching out the population with a mass awareness on Risk Communication during training sessions and awareness-raising through masajid in all target UCs. As far as the breakdown of planned deliverables for each target area is concerned, the activity &#x201C;crop production support to agri-farmers&#x201D; will only be carried out in two union councils of Jhal Magsi district as these both UCs are mostly agri-dependents while at the initial stage targets of other two activities i.e. unconditional cash grants and livestock are equally being planned for each target UCs. However, the actual distribution of the planned support is highly dependent on the validation of PSC data and the results of focus group discussions for the identification and selection of beneficiaries. The project will be implemented through the participation of Community Institutions fostered at Village amp UC level by BRSP and the cadre CRPs at each UC which will be a key in ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Security Response for vulnerable population of district Jhal Magsi, Balochistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to contribute to the PHPF 1st allocation strategy&#x2019;s objective of  providing humanitarian support to those whose livelihoods are severely affected and suffering from food insecurity. The project also targets to respond to the recent floods of August 2020.  

Following the floods, we carried out a Rapid damage and needs assessment and are proposing the following union councils:
TEHSIL GANDAWA: Union Councils Khari, Patri, Mirpur and 
TEHSIL JHAL MAGSI: Union Council Mat Sundar

During the need assessment, we found that different groups have different needs. There are those who have suffered significant losses and are unable to meet daily food consumption needs, their agriculture infrastructure is damaged but they have access to seeds for next cropping season. For such beneficiaries we have proposed 3 cycles of cash transfers through Cash for Work.

On the other hand, there are affected families whose head is an elderly or PWD or have other chronic condition due to which they are unable to work, for such beneficiaries we have proposed unconditional cash transfers (3 cycles)

Then there are affected families who cannot meet their food consumption requirements and do not have any arrangements for next cropping season. Such families are at a high risk for missing sowing season and are prone to relying on negative coping mechanisms. For such families, we have proposed a CASH+ packages (combination of cash and in kind Crop support). This will enable the families to meet immediate food needs while ensuring they have adequate arrangement for next cropping season. They will be provided cash grants for two months whereas an agriculture inputs package will also be provided to them. The input package proposed is climate smart and promises better results in terms of yields and water use classifying the package as an innovation. Therefore, for diffusion of innovation and ensuring adaptability, we will use a Farmer&#x2019;s Field School (initially facilitated by our field teams) where farmers, on regular intervals, will gather in small groups and will share their learning, approaches, what works and what doenst while our staff will also provide key inputs. 

Particularly for females, we have proposed a locally suited and culturally contextualized solution. We will enhance house hold food security through kitchen gardening. Women will be trained on managing kitchen gardening, knowledge amp skills on nutritional diet and COVID 19 prevention. Then they will be provided with a kitchen gardening package including assorted seeds and tools. Our teams will provide demonstration during the training and women will be extended support for sowing and managing their kitchen gardens by our staff. On the other hand, women will also be enrolled in a Farmer Field School. Through that, they will meet in small groups and discuss their approaches to gardening thereby creating a platform for exchange of ideas and sharing lessons learned.

Lastly, there are beneficiaries who rely mainly on livestock farming. Their food security is linked with viable livestock raising and selling. Since the floods have severely affected the grazing lands (referring to our assessment report) we will ensure viability of these farmers and their grazing lands through provision of fodder seeds and related inputs. Without such inputs, these farmers are at the risk of being further pushed in misery since they are likely to suffer from livestock death, weight loss and selling the livestock on significant losses. 

Furthermore, we have been undertaking similar projects in same region since 2010 in partnership with UNWFP and UNFAO. Since September 2020, we are also implementing an emergency response project in partnership with IRC in proposed district Jhal Magsi. For cash transfers, irrigation infrastructure, kitchen gardening, FFS and Fodder packages, we have in-house highly qualified staff with relevant qualification.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food for survival project for flood affected families of districts Sanghar and Badin, Sindh</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the month of August 2020, heavy rainfall resulted in major flooding in the Province of Sindh amp a province-wide Monsoon Flood Emergency was declared by the Government of Sindh on 25th August 2020. Subsequently on 29th August the provincial Government officially declared 20 districts as &#x201C;calamity affected areas&#x201D;, under the Sindh National Calamities (Prevention amp Relief) Act 1958. Pakistan is prone to multiple natural hazards, including floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides, snowfall, avalanches amp cyclones. The recent flooding has affected communities in both rural amp urban Sindh. In addition to crops, livestock amp houses, a lot of infrastructure has been damaged amp in some cases, people have been forced to take shelter in temporary camps.
The project will focus to provide the of food package to the flood affected communities to reduce the mortality amp morbidity among flood affected population through life saving food assistance amp as a direct or indirect consequence of COVID-19 outbreak in district Sanghar amp  Badin. Project activities include: 
Affected areas selection, selection of the most vulnerable families with the support of local CBOs, notables amp government officials. Then the verification and validation of selected beneficiaries will be conducted by HANDS MER Department in coordination with the respective district governments. Tokens in the name of beneficiary head of house hold will be generated through digitalized Beneficiary Management Information System (BMIS). Food commodities/items as per the given guidelines, will be procured by HANDS procurement and logistics department. Each district team will submit the detailed distribution plan. Accessible distribution points will be selected with community participation. HANDS Suggestion And Complaint (SAC) banner will be displayed at distribution points along with the list of food items. SAC brochures will also be given to the beneficiaries. HANDS District Executive Managers/ Project manager will orient the beneficiaries about COVID-19 preventive measures, details about the food package amp inclusion of all family members without any discrimination. 
  
The project is designed to cater the specific needs of women, men, girls, boys amp vulnerable groups in wake of heavy rains flood situation. The project intends to focus on specific areas of interventions recommended by the RNA to response the immediate needs in Food Security sector. HANDS proposed intervention districts Sanghar amp Badin are included in PHPF Five prioritized districts in Sindh for immediate response. The general food distribution plan (as per standard foods quantity) for specific duration for vulnerable families is proposed focused on men, women, children &#x2013; girls and boys, persons with disabilities, pregnant lactating mothers. The beneficiaries&#x2019; selection will be done on defined criteria, with support of district authorities, DDMA amp other stakeholders. 

Project staff will be oriented on HANDS Gender policy amp Protocols, GBV, PSEA, Leave No One Behind, Do No Harm amp Sphere standards. HANDS management amp monitoring team will ensure to implement on these policies amp protocols in the field. Community will be oriented about HANDS SAC policy, procedure amp contact numbers for any complaint amp information about any incident/ discrimination. HANDS senior management as per the defined protocol will address the complaint- if any. 

The migration of people due to flood situation is an immediate risk for project activities. Another risk is the security amp safety of the teams due to local conflicts amp large number of affected population. Coordination with district government amp community engagement may help to tackle this issue on the whole process of selection and food ration distribution. There are chances of second wave of COVID-19 to be observed intervention districts. To cope with this situation, PPEs amp orientation on COVID-19 prevention. SOPs will be provided to staff amp awareness will be provided to communities.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic have reached Pakistan in February 2020. As of May 14, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in the country is 35793, with 9690 recoveries and 775 deaths. Punjab is currently the region with highest number of cases at over 13561.  COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
The fragile health care system in Pakistan has further weakened on the onset of COVID- 19 where extra measures and steps are being required to combat the current pandemic situation and also continue the regular health care services to regular diseases like PHC, MNCH, SRH, Immunization and ANC, PNC care etc. The data shows that health care workers including Doctors and Paramedic and other health staff in health facilities are at high risk due non availability of appropriate PPEs, lack of capacities to handle corona patients&#x2019; situations, lack of proper equipping/ disinfecting the health facilities to control transmitting the virus in the premises of health facilities. This challenging situation has already taken the lives of frontline health staff and are constantly being affecting from the virus which is resulting in the gravity of the situation and need immediate response to tackle these issues and ensure enhanced capacity of the health care system at hospitals and in outreach health services to continue provision of the regular health services along with treatment of the corona patients.

In response the challenging situation out of COVID-19 pandemic, SHED will conduct capacity building/training program of the health staff including doctors, paramedics, vaccinators and outreach health workers in the targeted health facilities. The trainings will focus on IPC and other preventive measures as per WHO guidelines and protocols to continue essential regular health services in hospitals and in communities through outreach. The project will also organize trainings on implementation and monitoring of guidelines and protocols to health care providers. The health care workers at community level will be provided with trainings on preventive measures in COVID-19 situation for awareness raising in communities. The project will procure and provide appropriate PPE to targeted health facilities. For disinfection and infection prevention at facility level, the project will provide services to keep disinfecting the targeted health facilities with different measures hand sensitization of individuals, disinfecting OPDs, Wards, OTs, Labour Rooms, Testing Laboratories, staff offices, waiting rooms etc with approved sprays. This activity will continue through the project life. Medical supplies, RH medicines, dignity, newborn baby and delivery kits will be provided to the health facilities to continue outreach services at community level. The project will provide ambulance services to the selected health facilities on need basis. These services will be utilized for continuation of CEmOC services at tertiary care hospitals for referral cases. The project will identify and actively engage different community forums like District Support Groups, Local Support Organizations and Community Based Organizations to participate and support the project activities.

The project will focus on inclusion of gender, vulnerable population including age, PWDs, children, minority and ethnic groups, widows, orphans, transgender and extremely poors in all project activities. Ongoing monitoring along with line departments and communities will be an integral part of the project to ensure accountability and transparency. Protection of vulnerable groups will be ensured in each activity of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to EPI Balochistan in response to COVID-19 to resume Routine Immunization</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since COVID-19 appeared in Pakistan, Federal and Balochistan Government has responded with involvement of Health Deptt. All primary amp essential healthcare services were suspended including Routine Immunization (RI). Fully immunized coverage of Baluchistan is 29% which is the lowest in country. The other alarming figure is 24% Children with zero dose of any antigen. The performance of immunization program has improved with more focus from government/partner organization(s) but still a lot of efforts are required to achieve global/regional goals. Knowing that Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) cause around 24% of the mortality among children under five, continuation of RI services is imperative to avert the thousands of deaths.

The health system is already burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to counter future outbreak of any disease it was considered important that the routine immunization be resumed so that efforts made from decades may not be futile. Through this intervention, TF strives to strengthen EPI Program Balochistan in ensuring personal protection of EPI frontline workers, build trust of parents of children that vaccination staff is well prepared to prevent exposure of children during immunization process. The proposed project will supplement resumption of RI activities with safety of 1422 staff in 03 high risk districts i.e. Quetta, Pishin amp Killa Abdullah is ensured for at least 04 months period through provision of  Personal Protective Equipment (Masks, Gloves, Sanitizers, Disposable Gowns) to EPI Balochistan frontline workforce particularly Vaccinators, Lady Health Workers and Monitors. This will support the resumption of smooth routine immunization service with precautionary measures at frontline workers&#x2019; end, static EPI centers with hand washing protection and disinfection. The project will target the high-risk districts of Balochistan in both contexts&#x2019; vaccination under EPI and the Covid-19 with highest number of cases in targeted districts.  TF will also produce the advocacy material on COVID-19 precautions as well as social distancing protocols at district/community level as an integration to EPI activities. On the other hand, TF will develop IEC material regarding EPI in COVID-19 pandemic situation and importance of both the routine immunization and precautionary measures including social-distancing would be shared through a dedicated campaigning on social media (targeted advertisement) and at the static vaccination points with the information material (non-transferable) while important places at each district will be covered with IEC material placed in shape of banners/posters. All the 126 static centers will also be provided with the hand washing units with availability of soaps/water. The 126 facilities will also be provided with disinfectant liquid for the static facility disinfection with sprayer tools supporting routine disinfectant activities. 

The project will also focus on capacity building of the EPI frontline workers (Vaccinators, LHWs amp Monitors) focusing IPC protocols and guideline developed by federal EPI with technical support of WHO. Training of Trainers (ToT) will be conducted involving existing trainers from EPI/MNCH programs amp consultants. These MTs will be responsible to undertake trainings at the field in 03 districts to orient the front-line workforce on IPC in context of COVID-19 to resume the RI with precautionary measures and stop the spread of not only COVID-19 but other infections too. 

The overall support under the proposed project will be to operationalize the essential service of RI activities in 03 high risk districts through by EPI Balochistan for at least 04 months with minimum safeguarding against the COVID-19 spread with the approach of providing PPE to Frontline workers, capacity building on Infection prevention and control, hand washing and disinfection of EPI static centers, advocacy at district level through Social Media amp IEC Material.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian Response to COVID-19 in High Risk Districts of  Balochistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The pandemic situation of covid-19, globally affected people and their routine life. To respond the emergency, different initiatives have been taken to provide possible support to people in Pakistan. The proposed project is basically a supplementary effort to strengthen the fight against Covid-19 as an emergency response to Government of Balochistan. Project interventions are designed on the needs assessment carried out by BRSP in 778 public health facilities in May, 2020. 
The proposed project will strengthen the services of public health facilities and enhance the capacity of healthcare providers to minimize the spread of covid-19 in Balochistan. Besides capacity building of healthcare providers,  a total of 4,350 health facilities staff will be protected with the essential PPEs, ensuring hygienic environment and  changing behaviors through hand washing practices. Furthermore, the environmental hygiene will also be ensured through disinfecting work places within the health facilities. Proper usage of PPEs will also be ensured through close monitoring and follow-ups by the project staff. 
The targeted communities in high risk districts Quetta, Pishin, Chaghai and Killa Adbullah will be mobilized through indigenous social structures, community institutions such as COs, VOs, LSOs, CBOs, religious leaders and health committees on Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) of Covid-19. The indigenous community resource persons (Male amp Females) will the frontliners of the this mobilization campaign by using IEC material. The religious leaders and community influential will be part and parcel of this mobilization campaign, thus inculcating the hygiene behaviors among beneficiary communities. 
The proposed project has a high value and consideration for creating equal opportunity for women, so the specialized services on MNCH will be ensured for approximately 2,100 women during the project life in targeted health facilities, which would impact in reducing MMR in Balochistan. The tele health services introduced for MNCH services will create a model for government of Balochistan, which could be replicated in remotest districts of Balochistan. The proposed project will create an equal opportunity for 29,744 men, 27,456 women, 14,784 girls and 16,016 boys. BRSP has its strong focus on addressing person with disabilities,  around 6,000 (Men 2,028, women 1,872. Boys 1,092 and girls 1,008) will also be mainstreamed in the current project and will address 6000 (getting benefits of post projects. 

Keeping in view the rapid increase in population, consultations on sexual reproductive health including but not limited to adolescence SRH and gender based violence will be provided at basic health units and communities level. The proposed project will create an opportunity for the women in reproductive age for child spacing for their better health. The proposed project will have strong surveillance system  through establishing an efficient and effective MIS, which would serve as a decision support system for the Government of Balochistan.

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pakistan has witnessed a massive increase in its confirmed cases from the initial two confirmed cases on 26th February 2020. As a country whose economy is highly reliant on manufacturing and service industries, shutdown measures and disruptions in supply chains has negatively impact on the economy and society, particularly the poor. The shutdown measures have already impacted small businesses, small and medium enterprises and daily wagers associated with various sectors of the economy. 
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pakistan has risen to 40,151 as of 17 May 2020. Increase of 1,352 new cases in the last 24 hours. Test conducted so far is 359,264 out of which 1, 1341 recovered and 873 deaths. The most affected province due to COVID-19 virus in Punjab 14,584, followed by Sindh with 15,590 cases. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the total confirm cases are 5,847 with 305 deaths and 1,699 cases recovered. Active cases in KP is 3,843 which increases on daily basis.There are limited number of laboratories with limited capacity to confirm COVID-19 cases. Substantial progress in Laboratory testing has been made, daily testing capacity has increased from 6700 on April 22, to 13051 on May 13, 2020. This capacity is expected to reach 20,000 per day. Total 330750 tests have been performed as of May 14, i.e. KP 34352.  Given the current positivity rate of 8%, we, therefore, need to conduct 2 million tests to reach the projected 9,049 test per 1,000,000. The average local transmission in the country is around 89%: Sindh 92.69%, Punjab 86.18%, KP 85.49%, and Baluchistan 93.39%. 
The isolation and quarantine facilities are inadequate in number and the infrastructure unsuitable for isolation and quarantine. The standard operating procedures (SoPs) are not being implemented at both the isolation and quarantine facilities the facilities lack human resources, technical expertise, supplies, equipment and proper management. The people being quarantined or isolated are not properly briefed on the importance of social distancing and hygiene. Keeping in view the consistent spread and high ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases need urgent support to the PDMA, DoH, District Administration in the most affected districts of KP i.e. Peshawar and Swat.  
To provide immediate support in COVID-19 Pandemic and EHSAR strong sectoral experience the following allocation strategic activities have been selected with close consultation of district Administration, PDMA and DoH after proper Need Assessment.

	Training and Capacity Building of government and private health facilities staff (doctors, paramedical, vaccinator, and disease surveillance officer etc) to continue providing essential health services including provision of IPC, MNCH, immunization, antenatal, postnatal care and safe delivery services.  
	Support outreach activities through provision of medicines, medical supplies, maternal lifesaving supplies, modern contraceptives, and availability of basic maternal health equipment
	Provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment for government, community and   Public Health  Facilities including  Doctors, paramedics, LHW, CMW, FWW, FWAs, LHV, Dispensers, WMO/MOs and vaccinators.  
	Ensure continuity and effectively operationalized mobile units&#x2019; services in two districts of KP   to strengthen CEmOC referral and onsite SRH, including EmOC and maternal health care services.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Molecular laboratory Capacity for  COVID-19 testing in Pakistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic was notified in Pakistan on the 26th February 2020 from Karachi. As of 8th May 2020, a total of 25, 837 cases with 594 deaths (CFR 2.29%) had been reported. The National Institute of Health, the national reference public health laboratories acquired the requisite technical capacity for COVID-19 diagnostics on 1 February 2020. Since then the government has established over 50 other centres across Pakistan with capacities to conduct confirmatory tests for COVID-19. The centres are in all provinces and regions.  The centres have capacities to conduct up to 12000 tests/day. Over 60 technical staff has been trained on the testing protocols. The Technical Working Group on laboratory has developed key guidance documents for laboratory namely: National Guidance on sample collection, storage and transport of suspected COVID-19 samples, recommendations for priority COVID-19 testing and Recommendations for COVID-19 Laboratory Diagnostics and Quality Control. To date, over 257, 247 samples have been tested at these laboratories. 
The predicative analysis of expected cases load on the laboratory based on the attack rates from other countries indicates that there are likely to be over 196,421 cases in Pakistan. At the current detection rate of 8-9%, this will require a minimum of 3.136 million laboratory diagnostic tests to be conducted. In view of the predicted increased testing requirements for COVID-19 testing across Pakistan, there is urgent need to clearly map and expand the lab detection capacity to high case burden areas, linking the laboratory network with designated quarantine and health/isolation facilities to ensure early case finding, case isolation, contact tracing and management of confirmed cases. This project will contribute to increasing the numbers of testing sites as seen in the map 1 below. 
 
Key activities will include 
1. Support the diagnostic capacity at the existing laboratories through provision of Real Time PCR diagnostic kits amp reagents 
2. Procurement of Point of Care Testing (POCT) equipment and testing kits for the 10 laboratories
3. Installation of the Point of Care Testing (POCT) equipment at the identified labs with validation
4. Training of the facility staff by the equipment provider under supervision of WHO and NIH
5. Monitoring and evaluation of the POCT performance through retesting/rechecking
It is envisaged that these activities will contribute to increasing the number of tests for COVID-19 to a level of 20,000  per 1,000,000 people up from the current level of 1165 test per 1,000,000 (11000-12,000 tests per day).</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AWARE will provide WASH assistance to approximately 5000 families (Approximately 38,700 individuals (11,940 men, 12,265 women, 7133 boys, and 7362 girls) in through integrated WASH assistance over a period of three months. Based on the identified needs, to the most vulnerable and flood-affected persons targeted five Union Councils, Satriyoon, Araro Bhurguri, Samaro road, Samaro, and Gulzar Khalil of Taluka Samaro in district Umerkot are selected for humanitarian assistance in close coordination with District authorities, local communities, and civil society organizations.

Along the needs assessment conducted by One UN Provincial Programme Team Sindh, local partner&#x2019;s coordination with relevant stakeholders in Umerkot also guided the planning of culturally sensitive and locally relevant activities for emergency WASH assistance for sustainable resistance of the flood-affected communities. The AWARE team is already working in the proposed area since last decade and based on the information collected during recent flood assessment, regular coordination meeting with district authority during this emergency, reports of different stakeholders (government, I/NGOs, media, etc), generated a Flood Situation Report in August 2020.

Due to heavy rain torrential rains, many districts of Sindh (Umerkot and others) were severely affected by the floods The floods damaged the areas that were already extremely poor and added to the miseries of the people by creating food insecurity, shortage of safe drinking water (62%) and widespread of water-borne diseases in the area. Although there were efforts under a tent, cooked food by Government but there are many still pockets which still have an unmet need for improved quality of drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, and food security. AWARE being one of the organizations already worked with communities of the flood-affected area in the year 2011 with UNICEF and water Aid with the mandate for the provision of WASH services to the flood-affected communities.
&#x2028;The focus of the proposed interventions will be on the provision of access to potable water and the economic survival of flood-affected households. WASH interventions will include 02 water filtration units and 03 water tankering and aqua tabs to access and availability of safe drinking water for 5000 most flood-affected populations. For access to safe sanitation in flood-affected areas, the pit latrines will be provided with the inclusion of men and women, girls and boys of the communities&apos;. AWARE also will carry out hygiene promotion activities through inclusive and culturally compatible utilization approaches and NFI ( Mosquito nets, Jerrican and Tarpaulin sheets, and hygiene kits will be provided to ensure the personal hygiene along with these awareness-raising sessions on personal hygiene and COVID-19 will be conducted according to social distancing in designated SOPs.&#x2028;Transparency and accountability will be ensured through maximum participation of the right holders in beneficiaries selection coupled with cross verification of selected households through community-managed structures, project staff, and monitoring team members to office. The AWARE team will ensure compliance of PHPF gender criteria, CHS, and SPHERE standards. &#x2028;In close coordination with PHPF and WASH cluster will deter duplication of efforts through regular information sharing on the flood portal of UNOCHA and at district / provincial coordination forums. The main purpose of this project is to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and to help reduce the incidence of water, sanitation and hygiene, and related disease by providing WASH humanitarian assistance to most flood-affected families.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through a common service platform, implementing partners will jointly administer activities geared at curtailing COVID-19 transmission and fostering community resilience in dealing with the shock of the epidemic.

The combined forces of CCCM and WASH aim to deliver essential COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement activities while establishing necessary water points and handwashing platforms for better hygiene practices.  Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites.

AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster&#x2019;s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group.

SCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, WASH partners will organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partner via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP site. When feasible, WASH partners will provide of emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations and distribution of soap for hand washing to sites that do not have access these services.

Radio Ergo (contracted): Producing specialized COVID-19 response and prevention information detailing health referral pathways, COVID-19 knowledge, and incorporating radio shows with community members such as religious leaders and Camp Management Committee (CMC) members.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Access to lifesaving and Sustaining Education , Child Protection and WASH  Services to Flood Affected Children(Boys and Girls) in Jowhar and Mahaday  Districts, Middle Shabelle Region, Hirshabelle State of Somalia.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to respond to education, WASH and protection needs of children affected by floods in seven rural villages of Jowhar District of Middle Shabelle in Hirshabelle State of Somali for six months. The villages have either been affected by floods due to River Shabelle breaking its banks and flooding the settlements and farmlands in the riverine areas or flash floods sweeping the villages as a result of above-normal heavy Hagaa rains experienced in the region. The Guu rains expected between October and December are likely to result further deterioration of the situation.
Education facilities in the targeted villages are closed since most of them were affected either flood from river bank breakage that saw them completely inundated or marooned by water. 
The villages are generally food insecure as the population is faced with acute unemployment, the prohibitive cost of living, and lack of skill sets by majority of the dwellers to eke meaningful living. The situation is further exacerbated by cyclic droughts and flash floods that are making agro-pastoralism lifestyle untenable and thus many are dropping out to join the ever-increasing population of vulnerable persons in the riverine regions. The worst affected are children and women who often bear the brunt of neglect and abandonment during these hard times. This often makes them susceptible to abuses and exploitations such as Gender-Based Violence, sexual exploitation, early marriages, child labor and recruitment to armed groups. 
The project intends to use school attendance as an important preventive factor for child protection, particularly the girl-child. The project will employ such interventions as, training of teachers on basic child protection skills, provision of child-friendly environment through improvement and repair of damaged temporary/ permanent classrooms. Aid Vision will establish and strengthen the capacity of CtC clubs to provide peer interaction forums to learners, provision of teaching and learning materials-including recreational materials, capacity building of CBCPCs to raise awareness on risks of child abuse and enhance children&#x2019;s access and retention at schools. The CBCPCs will contribute to service mapping, identification of referral pathways and disseminate the information about available child protection service for children in the community. CP Focal Points, trained on PSS/PFA, will facilitate structured gender sensitive recreational and PSS activities at the schools for both boys and girls throughout the project live and conduct child safety walk and audit/ /risk mapping exercises with the guidance of project CP supervisor.
To address urgent WASH needs at the schools and ensure continuous learning for 2000 learners, Aid Vision will supply water to 7 schools for 6 months which will be delivered by trucks. Each school will have water storage tank with taps placed at strategic location for easy access. 23 twin gender-sensitive latrines will be constructed at schools that lack sanitation facilities. All latrines will have sufficient water, hand washing facilities and lockable doors for meaningful access. Girls and boys will attend CP awareness sessions to be organized for all schools. This is aimed at ensuring they have preventive skills on violence against children. Girls latrines usage will be monitored and corrective actions taken to address safety concerns. Regular hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on handwashing and safe water handling will be conducted at schools for 14 days to prevent the risk of AWD/Cholera outbreak. Hygiene promotion sessions will follow where schools&#x2019; health clubs will disseminate messages on good hygiene practices at schools. To ensure schools have sustained access to water 2 shallow wells damaged by floods will be rehabilitated and protected with hand-pumps. 9 manually operated hand-free hand washing stations will be installed and soap for hand washing provided to reduce risk/transmission of COVID-19.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of the global capacity support to the FGS in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) has received a request from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) to provide two 350 KVA generators in strengthening the functioning of the De Martino and Benadir Hospitals and the National Testing Laboratory. The appeal to the United Nations for support is a matter of urgency as those two referral facilities are facing a dire need to keep power stability while treating and testing patients with COVID-19.  
The RC/HC has decided to use the Humanitarian response funds to finance the support and requested UNDP to handle the procurement process to provide the generators. From the quotations already sought by the OPM, the estimate cost for the two generators is USD 160,000 including delivery and installation. UNDP is currently launching its own competitive sourcing to come up with financial proposals for contracting the supplier with the best value for money. Before a contract is signed, a budget should be available in Atlas, hence this submission in GMS to secure funding.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated specialized child protection and GBV services for boys, girls and women affected by floods in Balcad  Jowhar districts of Middle Shabelle region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the growing humanitarian crisis in southern Somalia SOS CVS is proposing the following interventions to expand lifesaving Child protection and GBV services to vulnerable populations in two districts in middle Shabelle region. SOS CVS will support the most deprived children, women and girls in IDP camps, those affected by emergencies, crisis and displacements, those at risk of family separation as well as victims of gender based violence whose vulnerability increases due to breakdown in community structures. The project will be implemented in two districts in Middle Shabelle region (Balcad and Jowhar)

The main objective of the proposed integrated protection project is to improve the protection of the targeted children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation in the target area. The  integrated protection emergency response  is designed to improve the protection of the target children, girls and women from abuse, violence and exploitation through provision of psychosocial and mental health support  and provide rapid identification, tracing and family reunification services for those at risk of family separations. In addition to this, unaccompanied and separated children in the intervention targeted IDPs will be reunified with their caregivers/guardians and those children who do not have caregivers/guardians will be supported through community based (clan/kafala) foster care placements.  Through existing Community Protection Committees (CPC), provide a platform to establish community&#xAC; based child protection mechanisms (CBCPMs) to facilitate the identification of and response to child protection concerns, the development of community&#xAC; based mitigation plans, prevention messaging (e.g. on forced recruitment) and child protection surveillance mechanisms. 

The project propose to create CFS at community level that will provide psychosocial and recreational support through structured and age appropriate group and individual activities including recreation, skill building and basic learning activities. The proposed CFS will also provide children with a protective and conducive environment to play socialize and learn to express themselves.  In addition, the project will provide psychosocial and parenting activities to both IDPS and host communities and their caregivers. The project will provide community-based PSS and resilience activities aimed towards coping and strengthening protective environment for children and their parents. Child right groups will be established at community level and provide psychosocial support (PSS) workshops (MHPSS) services to key targeted beneficiaries in view of increasing child resilience in IDP and surrounding communities. This will be conducted in the CFS centers at the community level.
The project will also carry out community based mapping to identify safety risk for children and provide  insight into what issues exist and better understanding of how issues connect to each other and plan for mitigation to support the identified risk.

The project is also designed to increase women and adolescent girls access to life saving prevention and response measures through providing GBV services, case management, PSS counselling to traumatized GBV survivors to reduce risk of GBV at target districts.  To provide timely, effective and efficient GBV responses, the proposed project will train health workers and caseworkers in CM and CMR of rape survivors.  Community based GBV volunteers will be trained to conduct GBV services awareness campaign. This will offer an opportunity to provide much needed response services in the target areas that are without GBV and protection services.  

Finally the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and CP AoR approved IEC risk communication and print it in local language as well general awareness child protection prevention messages.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to provide emergency shelter (ESK) and basic household items (NFIs) to 1,120 flood affected persons (1,504 men,  2,259 women, 1,508 girls and 1,449  boys) ii Balcad districts of Middle Shabelle Region.In line with the Shelter cluster guidelines and recommendation on response to the recent flooding in parts of Lower, Middle Shabelle and Hiraan regions, Mercy Corps will prioritize and target, the recent flooding displaced new IDPs and IDPs in protracted situation affected by the recent floods.   

These IDPs are currently residing in rural, peri-urban and urban informal crowded settlements, with insufficient access to basic services and poor shelter conditions that raise protection and health concerns. They remain in need of Shelter and NFIs support for protection from the current harsh climatic conditions, overall improvements to their living conditions and improvement to their chances to access livelihoods and durable solutions. On the other hand, Mercy Corps will target poor  host Communities households - to ensure peaceful coexistence between the local population and target groups and also because many of them are equally vulnerable and in need of humanitarian assistance. Mercy Corps will conduct direct distribution in line with the Shelter cluster minimum standards.

Mercy Corps will also where applicable use  other donor funded grants to compliment this Shelter response project to ensure sufficient support to the targeted vulnerable populations including where possible livelihood and WASH  interventions to the targeted participants thereby cushioning the affected HHs against the COVID 19 pandemic and to limit impact on livelihoods or negative coping strategies.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through a common service platform, implementing partners will jointly administer activities geared at curtailing COVID-19 transmission and fostering community resilience in dealing with the shock of this epidemic. The combined forces of CCCM and WASH aim to deliver essential COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement activities while establishing necessary water points and handwashing platforms for better hygiene practices.  Moreover, the use of radio media will look to provide an additional layer of awareness and critical thinking related to community-based responses and prevention of COVID-19 transmission.  Partners will continue to forge synergies with organizations, civil society, and local authorities operating within targeted IDP sites to greatly strengthen, reinforce and harmonize COVID-19 risk communication and hardware activities that are occurring within Deynile and Hodan IDP sites. AVORD: Through joint collaboration, AVORD will provide site-level RCCE encapsulating the cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Plan and adapting efforts based on findings from the CCCM Cluster&#x2019;s RCCE Feedback Assessment. Implementation of a site-level complaints feedback mechanism (CFM) will occur with the system adhering to the cluster&#x2019;s standards and following guidelines put forth by the Community Engagement Working Group. SCC (separate proposal): Through joint collaboration, SCC will be working WASH partners to organize hygiene promotion activities supported by CCCM partners via mobilizing community members and certain targeted members of the IDP sites. When feasible, WASH partners will provide emergency WASH services to IDP sites (water supply, hygiene promotion-installation, of handwashing stations, and distribution of soap for handwashing to sites that do not have access to these services. Radio Ergo (contracted): Producing specialized COVID-19 response and prevention information detailing health referral pathways, COVID-19 knowledge, and incorporating radio shows with community members such as religious leaders and Camp Management Committee (CMC) members.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Durable and Sustainable access to water, improved sanitation and hygiene to flood  vulnerable and marginalised and flood &#x2013;displaced communities in Balcad District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian situation in Middle Shabelle has deteriorated due ongoing flooding in last two consecutive rainy seasons and now communities in low lying areas along the Juba and Shabelle river valleys in south central Somalia are grappling with a new wave of flooding during Hagaa season due to the intensive rains started within the Ethiopian highlands. The worst affected districts by floods are Balcad, Jowhar and Mahaday in Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle) Afgooye and Wanlaweyn distr icts in Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Belet Weyne (Hiraan) where over 85 per cent of the displacement has occurred. The flooding situation in Balcad district has resulted in massive displacement affecting particularly children, mothers and the elderly who are now facing serious hunger, health and protection risks in an area already receiving little to no humanitarian assistance due to insecurity. The floods have destroyed food reserves and threatened food markets. Significant gaps have been reported in flood-affected areas regarding to food, emergency shelter, non-food items, and safe drinking water, sanitation facilities and poor hygiene. Mothers, children, and the elderly as well as disabled people are extra affected due to the fact that displacement puts them at risk of exploitation since they lack their normal income routines and familiar environment. People are at a high risk of hunger and illness such as water-borne diseases which has already been reported in some of the flood affected areas. The impact of the ongoing flooding in Hirshabelle compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The proposed project aims to save the lives of affected communities in Balcad district and enhance resilience building by provide safe, equitable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient water for drinking, cooking, personal, and domestic (15L/p/day) through by drilling and construction of 1 borehole and rehabilitation of 3 boreholes and 5 shallow wells, construction of 100 flood proof latrines that consider the disable people, distribution of hygiene and sanitation kits to improve sanitation conditions and establishment and train water management committees to the operation and maintenance of the facilities. The project will target the most vulnerable households (men, women boys and girls) affected  differently by the ongoing floods but give special attention to female-headed households, the  elderly and people living with disability. Market-based programming (MBP) will be considered in all the activities to strengthen and working with existing markets supply chains and service providers in project target areas to meet the needs of crisis-affected populations.GSA has extensive experience of working in the WASH sector within Balcad district and can mobilize rapidly due to strong links with communities and government.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency lifesaving and sustainable WASH services to the flood-affected most vulnerable and underserved communities living in Belet Weyne district of Hiran Region, Hirshabelle State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The impact of the ongoing flooding compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict, and forecast of below-average Gu rainfall from October to December 2020 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities through 2021. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods have been triggered by heavy, above-average rainfall locally and in upstream areas in the Ethiopian highlands and have affected Gedo, Hiraan, Middle Juba, and Middle and Lower Shabelle regions. The floods temporarily displaced households to higher grounds in several prone areas including Belet Weyne. The recurrent floods have inundated the roads, WASH infrastructures, crops, houses and etc. A cholera outbreak fueled by limited access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, and displacement has already been reported in some of the flood-affected districts, underscoring the need for urgent repair and rehabilitation to damaged WASH infrastructure and the provision of clean water. More cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are being reported in children under five years old, who are particularly vulnerable to disease, especially if their immune systems are compromised by malnutrition. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood in the Belet Weyne town and 9 villages in Belet Weyne district to 19,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved communities. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project the following WASH services:
Water:
- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) 
- Rehabilitation/construction of 29 flood-damaged shallow wells with hand pumps.
- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 29 WASH committees and 58 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting

Hygiene and Sanitation:
Lack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people&#x2019;s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. never the less, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: 

- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns to reach 19,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health centers, and feeding centers 
-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out 
-Distribute of 1,000 HP kits to 1,000 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and
- Construct 263 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines for the most affected community including latrines for disabled people in ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods.</narrative>

Education has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic with 1.53 billion learners out of school and 184 country-wide school closures, impacting 87.6% of the world&#x2019;s total enrolled learners. Drop-out rates across the globe are likely to rise as a result of this massive disruption to education access. Thus, the Somali Government took precautionary measures as stopping international flights, closing learning institutions, and banning large public gathers. As the Government continues to monitor the situation, CISP plans to mitigate and minimize the impact of school closure and interrupted student learning, particularly for the most vulnerable. As there is a lack of clarity on how the COVID-19 situation will evolve globally and locally in Somalia, CISP will forecast long-term contingency measures ensuring that the impact of COVID-19 on students will be addressed as schools remain closed. In Somalia, it has affected learning and forced the closure of learning institutions including schools and universities since March 18th, 2020. In responding to this outbreak, CISP adapts the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Higher Education (MoECHE) strategy on COVID-19 preparedness and response. 
The proposed 9-month intervention will target 12 schools with an enrolment of 3462 learners with the provision of food, TLM, and Dignity kit while 19,890 adults and children of school-going age children will be targeted with radio PSA and health messages to provide mitigation measures on the impact of COVID-19 on top of other existing challenges such as conflict, drought and desert locust for learners both school holidays and when schools reopen. The project will improve access to critical WASH inputs, emergency food for students to meet their food and energy needs, payment of emergency teacher incentives to motivate teachers to stay in the schools, provision of teaching and learning materials (TLM). Specific WASH activities will include the distribution of handwashing soaps, liquid detergents, rehabilitation of latrines, provision of storage water tanks, water trucking for schools with no constant water supply, and improving hygiene practices among children through engagement with school hygiene promoters. Following the Federal guideline on social distancing CISP will work with the ministry of health and MoECHE to explore the possibility of having smaller groups of teacher and CEC&#x2019;s to train so as to maintain 1.5-meter distance in order to implement a lifesaving training of hygiene and Sanitation on preparedness, mitigation and response to COVID-19 pandemic and identification of COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the school community. CISP proposes this project to improve access to quality education and making schools child-friendly for COVID-19, drought and conflict-affected communities, and host community children Galgaduud region of Galmudug State of Somalia. The project directly addresses the educational needs of both the displaced and host community children. This project will create a protective environment for children through the improvement of hygiene/sanitation in schools thereby making schools learner-friendly and also the provision of quality education through providing learning resources, general community sensitization through radio PSA will be aired through Galmudug radio station on the COVID-19 pandemic awareness and prevention.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The recent floods in Most parts of Bay and Bakool has resulted in massive displacements compounding the already worsened crisis brought about by the protracted effects of drought,  as well as increased fighting in certain areas of Somalia and the most recent Covid-19 pandemic which started in Wuhan in China sometime in December 2019 and has spread globally infecting more than 1.6 million people and killing over 170,000 with Somalia ,registering 274 infection and 8 deaths as at 22nd April 2020 (WHO)  has leftleaving residents of Bay and Bakool increasingly vulnerable. Destruction of school infrastructure was largely reported by the Joint Xudur Mission that included the cluster and regional parters (Inter-Agency Rapid Needs Assessment Report for IDPs and Vulnerable Host Community in Xudur town, Bakool region-Somalia 4-6 February 2019). The floods displaced learners and teachers, destroyed infrastructure and learning materials and left the residents with the risk of cholera/AWD. Abuses such as recruitment of children into militias have been reported by a number of agencies all of which gravely affect learning processes.
This project is designed to reach IDP children of school going ages in Holwadag Primary School, Misnagato IDP school, Wariri IDP School, Bakaro Yarey IDP School, Madhayto IDP school, Awdinle Primary School in Baidoa Mama Gedia, Bulow primary, Shodog primary school in Xudur and Bardaale primary school, Abubakar, Aldarein primary school, Abuhureyra, Al-Ahli and Sheikh Hamud school in Berdale all of which are in Bay and Bakool to
1) Provide immediate education and hygiene response services integrated with activities and services in response to covid-19 prevention for the most vulnerable children through provision of basic school supplies while focusing on rehabilitation of infrastructure for school damaged by floods in Xudur.
2) Increase resilience through the provision of basic education and hygiene trainings in INEE/TiCC for teachers and school management for CECs to support school-based resilience mechanisms that will contribute to the sustainability of education programs
3) Build the capacities of teachers and CECs to better respond to child protection issues and Covid-19 prevention issues as per Integrated Education and Child Protection response framework and in line with WHO guidelines on Covid-19 response.
The project targets 15 primary schools in Bay and Bakool region affected by the protracted crisis and floods in South West State. READO in response to emergency-affected learners has proposed this project to mainly retain 4684 learners (2096 girls) and 35 teachers (11 female) and 24 CECs (12 female) at school in mitigating the case of high school dropout rate following effects of prolonged drought and floods. The project will focus on the provision of quality learning opportunities through

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustaining Life-Saving Support for Identified Vulnerable Households in Adado District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2020 and the 1st 2020 SHF Standard Allocation for the Food Security and Livelihood as it applies to project planned target District of Adado (South Mudug Region). The project will provide lifesaving support to 750 HHs assessed to be in acute food insecurity, &#x2018;Crisis&#x2019; phase of IPC (3)  by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and safety net support. The 750 beneficiaries will receive UCT amounting to a food transfer value of US $100 for 4 months to support a food purchase that meet the minimum 2100 kcal/person/day.

The project proposes lifesaving interventions that are gender sensitive, adapt centrality of protection and that mainstream gender and protection in the delivery methods proposed. The project will specifically prioritize destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the Adado Districts) and other households as identified in the Adado District that fall into the IPC 3. The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor recovery from the 2016-17 drought that were followed by below average Deyr 2018 and Gu 2019 season rains in Central Somalia Region. The project will also support the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Haradhere District who have sought refuge in Adado District after being displaced by the Non-State Actors keen on forcibly recruiting the children (boys) to be trained in their militia and also being forced to part with their animals on what amounts to illegal taxation for the Zakaat.

The project seeks to improve households&#x2019; immediate access to food to 750 vulnerable households in Adado District of Galgadud Region through Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) for 4 months.  The project will undertake a vulnerability assessment in selected locations of the targeted 6 locations in the District (3 settlements with IDPs and 3 settlements with high number of vulnerable host households) with the findings being used in developing the criteria for selection of the planned UCT beneficiaries and informing on protection needs.  Priority for the UCTs beneficiaries will be given to women-led households from the most vulnerable among recently displaced and socially marginalized communities in the District. The UCTs planning will also be supported by a market analysis undertaken in the District (undertaken by the FSL Team) to determine the capacity of local markets to absorb the resources extended to the beneficiaries. 

The project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure that the project gets feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and arising gaps that will require humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible effects of the locusts that are expected to spawn again with the coming Gu 2019 season. In addition the project will monitor the trends of COVID-19 pandemic and support groups that may be at risk of a lockdown in case of an increase in food prices given the interruption of supply chains as will be authoritatively captured authoritatively captured by WFP Somalia in its Supply chain monitoring briefs.  The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular helps make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project to ensure it provides the women safety and protection require</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communicable diseases specifically for children under five and women is a major contributor to maternal and child mortality and morbidity among the populations in humanitarian crisis in Jalalaqsi. Access to basic primary healthcare  services is severely constrained due  to funding gaps that has resulted in in very few health facilities functioning.The proposed project aims at scaling up primary health services in two health centers managed by ZamZam. Services provided at the health centers will be based on the EPHS standards for Somalia.The health facilities will be strengthened to provide  MPHSS services and CMR for GBV survivors. Existing staff will be trained and re-deployed. Essential health supplies will be procured  and made available in the supported sites.To take services closer to the rural villages and undeserved populations,the project will also operationalize one well equipped mobile health unit that will visit 11 villages.The unit will be attached to one of the health centers and will provide  emergency health services five days a week.The mobile health unit will provide immunization for children under one,treat common illnesses using IMNCI strategy,focused antenatal care,postnatal care,education and awareness on common illnesses and malnutrition among other important actions. One  ambulance will be hired to support referral of children with danger signs and obstetric emergencies.In total ,40600 persons among them 1624 children under one,8120 children under five and 3654 pregnant and lactating women are expected to directly access health services through the planned intervention.The project will be integrated with other complementary interventions implemented by ZamZam as well as other organizations working in the region. ZamZam is already running CMAM program which will easily integrate with the planned project.Quality assurance measures including quarterly joint support supervisions,data quality checks and continuous monitoring visits will be prioritized.In addition, community health promotion activities will also included public health messages on COVID-19 risks of outbreak in Somalia. In addition, ZAMZAM will scale up COVID-19 Risk communication and Community engagement:
1. Training of Health workers on implementation of standard Infection prevention and control guidelines of COVID 19
2. Dissemination of COVID-19 prevention and control messages from local FM radio in Hiran with 3 prime time spots for morning ,afternoon and evenings.
3. Print and disseminate IEC materials developed by MOH/WHO to health facilities and communities

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Health and Nutrition services through support for fixed facilities and mobile outreach through the Integrated Emergency Response Teams (IERTs)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project has been developed in line with the Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the health and nutrition cluster strategic objectives of providing integrated lifesaving health and nutrition services for the cluster priority districts in Nugaal regions i.e. Garowe districts. It is also contributing to the cluster priority of filling critical gaps in health care services for populations facing high incidence of malnutrition and service gaps.
The project has also been designed with full awareness of the prevailing gender norms and deeply rooted gender inequalities in Somalia that limit women and girls from accessing basic services such as health and nutrition, and expose them to a higher risk of GBV. In order to address these challenges, Save the Children will identify and work to remove the physical, cognitive and social barriers by collaborating closely with the communities and particularly the influencers and gatekeepers. We will also address the intersectionality of vulnerability factors, for example women with disabilities or from minor clans who are likely to face multiple levels of discrimination.
The project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health and nutrition services through the support of static health facilities complemented by mobile outreach services. There will be one integrated health and nutrition mobile team in Garowe district. The integrated health and nutrition mobile team will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi&#xFB01;cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to out-patient therapeutic programme (OTP), Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP) and stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the nearest stabilization centre. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health and nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition, and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. As part of gender and social norms transformation we will ensure that the activities include positive messaging for men in their roles as fathers. Women and girls will be seen by health practitioners of the same sex and consultations and documentation will be kept confidential.
Save the Children (SC) will support nine fixed facilities in the following locations Waabari MCH, Gabmbool MCH, Gargar MCH, Jilab MCH, Barwaaqo MCH,Bahnano 1 MCH, Bahnano 2 MCH, Hanano MCH and Awrculus MCH    with integrated health and nutrition services in addition to the mobile and iCCM services. SC will carry out regular safety audits of the facilities to identify and mitigate the risks faced by women and girls in accessing services and resources.
We would like to note that Save the Children is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. Save the Children will be considering the four following dimensions and is currently developing plans for staff health, business continuity, programme preparedness and programme response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving emergency shelter kits and NFIs to vulnerable populations with a focus on newly displaced and protracted  IDPs, and affected IDP hosts in Dollow, Luuq, and Garbaharey Gedo Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project seeks to provide lifesaving assistance to 3954 HH (Boys=4744, Girls=7118, women=7828, Men=4034) in Gedo region (Dollow, Luuq and Garbaharrey) through the distribution of Non-food Items (NFIs) and Emergency Shelter Kits (ESK). They will be distributed to newly arrived IDPs, protracted IDPs and affected host who did not receive any assistance in 2019 or early 2020 and mainly affected by flood. The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) living in the IDP site reside in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that jeopardize their physical security, privacy, and from vagaries of nature and diseases. 

Under this project, HAPEN will distribute 3954 NFIs and 3954 ESKs as in-kind to 9 IDP site in Gedo region Dollow: (Kabasa = 655, Qansahley = 550, Host 100), Luuq: Jazeera =314, Xero kowad= 470 and Boyle=420 Host =100), and Garbahrey: (Towfiq =270, Tula qorah =345, Hashi Weer =380, Tafta taag =250 and Host 100).

Beneficiaries will be selected through a participatory process driven by a representative project and site management committees while ensuring marginalized groups interests are catered for and vulnerable approach, considering issues such as women-headed and child-headed households, orphans, disabled, the old among and new arrivals, protracted, and distribution.

The proposed intervention targets 3654 IDP HHs (21,924 IDP persons) and 300 IDP host HHs (1,800) in Dollow, Garbaharey and Luuq. The protracted IDPs targeted are those living in Grabahrey. These families belong to most vulnerable IDPs who live in makeshift buuls without adequate access to NFIs and Emergency Shelter. 

Following a need-based and transparent selection of beneficiaries and on local market conditions, HAPEN will facilitate a direct-distribution program through which targeted IDPs and select host communities will receive ESKs and NFIs. HAPEN will employ an owner-driven approach in the construction of emergency shelters by capacitating the IDPs to undertake the construction process.

Protection and GBV concerns will be factored during site selection and will be integrated in all aspects of the response. Proper site planning will be undertaken to ensure effective mitigation of hazards and reduce alarming congestion levels in target settlements.

On monitoring and evaluation, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution and construction respectively. Therefore, two PDM exercises will be conducted for the two phases of NFI distributions. The monitoring exercise will provide beneficiary feedback on the effectiveness and collate lessons of the distribution. 90% of the beneficiaries will take part in the exercise to ensure proper representation and accurate reflection on the process and quality of the intervention. 

The PDM will support measuring beneficiary satisfaction of the items distributed and identify the needs and feelings of the community better. The exercises will inform on the effectiveness of the activities and achievements of targets while providing guidance towards the overall objective. 

3 Community Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) desks, one for each district of operation will be established, in addition to the hotline and PDM /PCM. COVID-19 preventative mechanisms will be adopted in CRFM and during distribution to minimize any occurrence of infections.

The desks will be manned by two personnel and the anticipated data to be collected include among others both compliments and complaints: the quality of the ESKs and NFIs, beneficiary selection processes, shortness of items distributed, delays and other unexpected feedback. HAPEN&#x2019;s staff will analyze the collected data and respond accordingly. This will ensure that community participation and AAP are enhanced.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP Families (13,296 persons) in Afgoye and Marka districts of Lower Shabelle region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is intended to address the emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 persons) of newly conflict and flood affected population as well as the most vulnerable protracted IDP families for life-saving in both districts &#x2013; Afgoye and Marka &#x2013; Lower Shabelle region.  With the presence of the Somali National Army (SNA) and AMISOM, Al Shabab, and clan militia, the security situation in the region had become more volatile than it was before. Security operations carry out by SNA and AMISOM alongside the USA drone airstrike targeting Alshabaab Militia caused humanitarian consequences to the civilians in the region. Within March 2020, joint forces SNA/AMISOM took over Janale village as a strategic business center it is about 13KM to Marka district. As a result, an estimated number of 3,200 HHs mainly women, children, and elderly people have fled from Janale to the IDPs in Marka, Afgoye villages as well as Mogadishu to escape from the violence. 
Thus, based on findings from rapid needs assessment through direct surveys of IDPs in Marka villages and telephone interviews with IDPs in Afgoye villages conducted by HINNA team in the region, this project is assigned to address emergency shelter and NFIs needs of 2,216 IDP families (13,296 people) of the newly conflict and flood affected population including those protracted IDP families who have recently received any shelter and NFIs assistance in 10 IDP sites in the areas with high severity and people in need &#x2013; 5 in Afgoye namely Aytire, Baalguri, Damaley, Sagaalaad, and Mareereey and 5 in Marka namely Buulo Samoow, Buufoow Bacaad, Moallin Ali, Abukar Same, and Cell Fareey who are in dire need of shelter and NFIs assistance as they live in bushes that endanger their lives and dignity. During beneficiary registration, the project will give more priority to most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as IDPs with larger families, families with disabled and elderly persons, female headed-households and etc.
Although markets in both districts are functioning the main challenge is that IDP settlements are far from them. However, according to the preference of project target IDP community including existing camp management committees, camp leaders and local authorities who participated in consultation meeting conducted through direct observation and phone interviews about the modality of assistance, this project will use in-kind distribution modality of 2,216 ESKs and 2,216 NFIs to project direct target beneficiaries of 2,216 HHs (13,296 persons) in both districts. In the context of COVID 19, decongestion and site planning/rearranging shelters will be considered in consultation with IDP communities and in close coordination with the cluster. 
During the implementation, the project will ensure using cluster guidelines to improve the living condition of the targeted beneficiaries by restoring their privacy, protection, and dignity. Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) will be conducted four to six weeks after to assess the quality of the distribution and process, utilization, and its immediate impact in saving lives and the satisfaction of beneficiaries about the NFI items distributed and/or the shelters constructed and it&apos;s quality. This will help us know more about the future preference of IDP communities.
The main objective of the project is to ensure that 13,296 persons (2,216 HHs) of newly displaced, and protracted IDPs affected by conflict and natural disasters have the protection from the weather and have privacy through the provision of 2,216 Emergency Shelter (ESKs) and 2,216 NFI kits to 2,216 households (13,296 persons: (1,728 men, 2,925 women, 3,324 boys, and 5,319 girls)). The project will ensure full coordination among humanitarian service provides especially shelter cluster partners who are working in the project areas in order to avoid duplications.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of sustainable life-saving WASH assistance to the most vulnerable drought and AWD affected communities in Eyl , Nugaal region,  Puntland</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The recent WASH assessment report conducted by KAALO in Nugaal region in December 2019 indicated that  65% of the assessed households (700HHs) did not meet the minimum recommended sphere standards of 7.5L/day. Villages settlements assessed including shale, Qarxis, Eyl and Canjeel, budunbuto villages and host communities (32%) are facing insufficient access to safe drinking water to cover all family water needs and 84% primarily rely on unprotected water sources. IDPs (98%) and host communities (54%) have no sufficient access to hygiene commodities (soap, detergent, etc.). 86% have insufficient access to latrines and bathing areas. Many households practice open defecation due to the lack of latrines. Thus, people Use of unprotected water points and berkeds.  transportation of water is done  by donkeys and camels exposing to water borne disease . 
The proposed project is to response the existing WASH gaps to drought and vulnerable  affected people in Eyl district in Nugaal region, KAALO proposes to provide WASH interventions mainly increasing access to water and improvement of hygiene and sanitation standards to the target groups men, women and children during this critical period of water shortage and Acute Water Diarrhea (AWD) risks in providing safe water and good sanitation practices through: (1) Rehabilitating of two (2) spring water points equipped with hybrid system in Eyl districts in Nugaal region respectively. (2) Rehabilitation of (7) berkads through rehabilitation of cracks and provide roof to protect dust and animals to get in and will protect water contamination hence reduced  AWD cases . 3)Provide emergency water for voucher to 1000 drought-affected households. Each household will receive voucher redeemed, number of persons/hh x 7.5 lt/person/day for 30 days. (4) WASH committees and well operators will be trained  on management amp maintenance and Disaster Risk Reduction to keep the sustainability of the rehabilitated water infrastructures ,a  total of 9 wash committees will be trained, each facility will have one wash committee . KAALO will target the most affected people with equal access to boys, girls, men and women. (5) Construction of 50 gender separated latrines with washing basin and lockable doors for privatization purpose. Sensitization within members of WASH committees are needed, 6)community education activities on hygiene practices will be widely used to promote greater hygiene promotion and key messages on  COVID-9 risks in Somalia. 7) Distribute 1000 HP kits to 1000 households (6000 PEOPLE ) who are at risk of AWD and malnutrition. Each HP kit consists (1 jerry can (20L), 1 bucket (20L), 3 bars of 800mg of soap ,1 menstrual hygiene and 200 aqua tabs).KAALO will ensure that the proposed WASH project will be fully in line with WASH cluster strategy and also will build the existing market system in Nugaal region and create job creation for beneficiaries including IDs.. Distribution of sanitation tools to at 5 IDP camps to reduce AWD cholera and COVID 19, This activities will support environmental sanitation. Each IDP camp will be allocated 6 sanitation tools and each tool comprises 1 wheelbarrow, 1 pickaxe, 1 rake, 2 shovel, 2 brooms, 1 box of gloves and 1 box of nose mask). The sanitation tools will be under the custody of IDP leaders or gate keepers and used only during the clean-up environmental campaigns in camps. The IDPs  will undertake environmental sanitation campaign using the distributed sanitation tools and Kaalo CHPs will support and monitors and report the voluntary-based clean up campaigns, especially in IDP settlements and its environments.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, Somalia had been hit by Multiple threats from Covid-19, locusts, conflict, insecurity, forced evictions, droughts, and flooding. The number of people in need has consistently increased over the last three years, from 4.2 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020 and 5.9 million in 2021 according to the CCCM cluster Acaps review. This is further reflected in the number of displaced people in 2020/2021. 47% of the population of 12.3 million needs some form of humanitarian assistance, including 2.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), with an additional half a million displaced on average per year as a result of climatic conditions and conflict. Most displacement-affected persons face multiple or recurrent displacements, with a majority of IDPs having been displaced at least five times previously and very few return to areas of origin. Post-Gu IPC analysis conducted in September 2020 by FEWSNET and partners, indicates that an estimated 1.7 million people are anticipated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with 0.4 million persons experiencing an emergency (IPC Phase 4). An additional 3.0 million persons are expected to be Stressed (IPC Phase 2), with the current conditions projected to remain unchanged by end of 2020. Projections running into 2021, through May, predict continued Stressed (IPC 2) and Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes to persevere, largely due to continued struggles of affected households to overcome shocks. Households in IDP areas in the Banadir region are facing food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3), driven by the high cost of living and limited income-earning opportunities. This notwithstanding, the sustained and large-scale humanitarian coordination is preventing more severe outcomes in many regions across Somalia. Camp coordination and camp management is a relatively a concept that&#x2019;s limited within the region and it is of utmost importance that key stakeholders i.e. government officials and humanitarian actors, be sensitized to this concept. 

SCC will implement these activities in 20 IDP sites in Kahda district of Banadir region with over 30,000HHs as per the latest detailed site assessment (DSA), targeting a largely underserved area. Approximately 36000 IDPs (6000 households) will benefit from this proposed intervention, in addition to the community working in these sites including local authorities, clusters, and other NGOs. These numbers might vary due to external factors, which might attract more IDPs, excessive flooding, or conflict with the landowners or the authorities, which may cause IDPs to flee to other areas. Gender will be mainstreamed into the project through the specific consideration of the different needs of women, men, boys, and girls during the design of activities. The project will ensure that all participants have equal access to resources and training. Monitoring and evaluation will be based on gender, age, and diversity dis-segregated data. SCC will implement this intervention in the Kahda district of Banadir region targeting 6000 HHs. Kaxda District is one of the IDP major hubs in Mogadishu that hosts the largest number of IDPs. Throughout the project, the needs of women, girls, men, and boys of all ages will be addressed throughout the planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation of the activities. Through regular site monitoring, needs and gaps will be reported and shared with partners and all stakeholders. Particular attention regarding needs will be paid to women and girls who also have to contend with GBV and protection concerns within camp settings. Through this project, SCC will also address the current and newly identified needs by setting up camp coordination structures at the national and, where necessary, regional or district levels, facilitating and supporting the establishment of effective coordination and management in IDP sites while respecting national context and authorities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the living conditions of 36,000 displaced people in Banadir through improved site management and coordination, enhanced service delivery and site upkeep and
decongestion initiatives.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to enhance the living conditions and access to service for estimated 36,000 IDP persons from 40 settlements in Kahda and Daynile districts of Benadir. This will be achieved through a number of interrelated and complementary activities including enhancing the capacity of camp governance structures and site-level committees to promote information-sharing and foster system-wide coordination among service providers. Key program activities also include organizing site-level coordination meetings among service providers and local authorities to highlight priority needs and challenges, mitigate protection risks and ensure efficient use of existing referral pathways. 10 site-level mobilizers, each serving as a focal point for 4 sites, will be hired from target IDPs to circulate key messages, report on gaps, conduct service mapping, needs and new arrivals, conduct site monitoring and take shelter-level CFM complaints in close coordination with the CCCM cluster and other partners to effectively address vulnerabilities and maximize efficiency of the humanitarian response. 

Site maintenance committees and IDPs in target settlements will be equipped with a range of site maintenance tools and supplies before engaging in cash-for-work schemes through which community-led site upkeep and maintenance activities will be carried out. In the selection of cash-for-work beneficiaries, AVORD will adapt a systematic approach with a clear criterion to prioritize the most vulnerable households including the marginalized, single headed-households, large families and/or families with children under the age of 5, women at risk as identified by protection officers and those with special needs. Data collected to inform beneficiary selection will be segregated by gender to ensure that no group is left-out. List of beneficiaries along with their contact numbers will be availed to SHF and other actors responding in the area to avoid overlap. 

The effectiveness of the aid package will be evaluated through monitoring of activities thus ensuring that beneficiaries access their services safely and in a dignified manner. Protection will be mainstreamed throughout project duration by closely coordinating with other partners operating Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) crisis centers and facilitating principled referrals where necessary. An elaborate feedback and complaint mechanism will be setup to ensure accountability to the affected population. Target sites will be prioritized based on vulnerability such as congestion levels, proportion of minority groups, potential exposure to protection risks and overall living conditions. AVORD will utilize cluster tools such as the IDP site risk map or DSA data in the process of site selection. A site-level Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be developed and the project team will ensure that the system is accessible for all populations and that the mechanism is clearly understood and supported by the community.

The present proposal will complement an interagency program currently being implemented by AVORD and other partners in Banadir to provide WASH and awareness raising services to reduce Covid 19 transmission. Synergies will be developed with these activities to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the resources.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased Access to Sustainable Education Services for IDPs and Children from Vulnerable Host Communities in Gedo Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention aims to ensure children and youth affected by pre-drought conditions as well as COVID-19 pandemic have access to safe and protective learning environments in under-served and hard-to access areas in Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow districts of Gedo, and are also able to access immediate and sustained learning opportunities. Further, the intervention proposes to support learner retention, improve learning environment and ensure safety of learners. The intervention has been designed to meet the needs of vulnerable girls, women, boys and men, IDPs and host communities in the three target districts (Luuq, Belethawa and Dolow). In ensuring centrality of protection, the program has been designed to enhance awareness/dissemination of child protection amp safeguarding principles with targeted girls and boys through establishment of leadership networks/clubs/platforms in targeted public schools in Gedo region. The intervention has based a big bulk of its outputs towards supporting IDP children (70%) and children from vulnerable host communities to enroll in permanent functional schools within Gedo, to ensure sustainability. The intervention is designed to build on gains made by the ongoing Education Cannot Wait (ECW) project as well as DFID funded Leave No Girl Behind (LNGB) which targets the same schools and locations, and to leverage and complement on other sectoral interventions in the same schools (WASH, Protection, Health), and will adopt an integrated approach that will focus on drought, protection, COVID-19 prevention and control, and life-saving interventions. In order to ensure access to safe and protective learning environment for vulnerable learners, the intervention shall among other key interventions: construct/rehabilitate TLS, provide safe drinking water hygiene promotion in schools (including COVID-19 prevention and control messaging), distribute sanitary kits to girls, establish school WASH facilities based on need, distribute TLM, pay emergency teacher incentives, provision of school feeding program as well as implementation of child protection activities in line with the education and child protection integrated response framework. The intervention will be implemented in a total of eighteen (18) schools in Gedo Region. The final list of schools will be agreed upon together with the Gedo Education Cluster Focal Point (HIRDA) to ensure that only the most needy drought-affected schools are supported. A draft list of the schools (including locations) to be supported is provided in the documents section.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide Emergency response and restoration of livelihood assets related to food and income sources for population affected by multiple shocks in Gedo region Somalia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Critical humanitarian needs persist in Somalia across the different livelihood groups whose vulnerabilities continue to worsen due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic and escalating conflict. The poor Deyr rains (October to December 2020) led to the inadequate pasture for livestock, water shortage and below average crop production. The deteriorating food security outlook combined with the worsening malnutrition appeals for a rapid, well-targeted and coordinated scale up of responses to save lives and recovery of livelihoods assets. The project aims to improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihood assets related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages through conditional cash transfers to enhance livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of water infrastructures and provision of fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in agro-pastoral and pastoral villages in Belet-Hawa district, Gedo region. 
The project will target 815 vulnerable drought affected agro-pastoral and pastoral households among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households who are classified under IPC 3 amp 4. The detrimental effects of the current shocks have severely and directly affected rural communities whose sources of food, income and water are diminishing and increasingly at risk leading to household food insecurity, increase in debt levels among poor households and a severe reduction in access to safe water for both domestic and livestock use. Additionally, the affected households rely on food purchase from local markets, have weak purchasing power due to limited income and lack access to credit services due to cumulative debts. 
COOPI prioritizes respect for the rights, dignity and safety of the people affected by crisis and is committed to taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the populations benefiting from the intervention. During implementation process, target communities, especially women, girls and the disabled will be included in community representative committees and decision making processes In selection of beneficiaries, registrations, verifications and monitoring exercises so as ensure that the most marginalized and vulnerable are represented and have influence. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. In order to improve household immediate access to food, conditional cash transfer will be provided to 815 affected household including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services.
To restore livelihood assets of households, 815 beneficiaries will engage in cash for work activities construction and/or rehabilitation of water catchments and water harvesting structures (soil bunds), 150 households among the CFW beneficiaries will also be provided with fodder seeds (Sudan grass) in the areas where soil bunds structures have been constructed to regenerate pasture to ensure availability of fodder for livestock. This activity aims at restoring livestock assets of the communities and envisages reducing workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for feeding livestock. In addition, gender based violence and exploitation malpractices associated with in search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. In summary the following activities will be carried out:
1. Provide conditional cash transfer to 815 households in Belet-Hawa district to increase household purchasing power and rehabilitate livelihood assets and water sources.
2. Support to fodder production through provision of Sudan grass seeds) for 150 affected households in Belet-Hawa district.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support for Improved Immediate Access to Food for Vulnerable Households in Galkayo South, Mudug Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 and the 1st 2021 SHF Standard Allocation for Food Security and Livelihoods that will respond to acute water shortages in Galkayo South (Mudug region), which are experiencing pre-drought conditions.

The Project will improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihoods related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages occasioned by pre-drought conditions, conflicts and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The Project targets an estimated 706HH (4,236 people) assessed to be in acute food insecurity, &#x2018;Crisis&#x2019; and &#x2018;Emergency&#x2019; phases of IPC (3 and 4) by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and water support. The project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 662 unskilled labourers and 44 semi-skilled labourers rehabilitating 9 Water Pans in 9 settlements in Galkayo South. Each of the 662 unskilled labourers shall get $6 per day while each of the 44 semi-skilled labourers will work at the rate of $8 per day:- Daily work output per person per day as per the Somalia CWG standards is 1.585M3 ( 5hours* 0.317M3). The total number of working days is 25 for each water pan, However, they will be rehabilitated in different months to allow for prudent supervision, monitoring and evaluation and reporting by the project team. The nine water pans to be rehabilitated are 1. Gaarcad, 2. Dhagfaruuryaale, 3. Cinjirre, 4. Laamawayne, 5. Rasan, 6. Balicadde, 7. Xaarxaar, 8. Qooraseyn, 9.Biyogaduud.

The project will specifically prioritise destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the four Districts). The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains and Desert locust infestation leading to inadequate pasture, water resources and below-average crop production in Central Somalia Region. 

The project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below-average rainfall for the coming Gu 2021 season as indicated by FEWSNET/FSNAU in its February to September 2021 update. 

The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries, ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project activities to ensure it provides women the safety and protection required. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. 

CPD plans to use the first 2 months of the project to undertake household vulnerability assessment in the identified locations within South Mudug, undertake community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration for the Conditional Cash Transfers beneficiaries captured in KoboConnect. The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). The rehabilitation works involving excavation of water pans to required provided dimensions will be done across 3 months for the 9 sites in Galkayo South of Mudug region. Payments to the unskilled and semi-skilled labourers will be made through Mobile Money Transfer once the scheduled work is completed. The project will carry out post-distribution monitoring in the final month of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Quality Life Saving Emergency Primary Health Services for Crisis affected populations living in  Hobyo District of Mudug Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will deliver lifesaving emergency health services including maternal, neonatal and child health through 2 static Health facilities (Galbarwaako and Elgula) and 1 mobile health clinic serving far flung villages without static health facilities in close proximity in Hobyo District. This action will complement and strengthen CESVIs health care provision activities in the above stated locations with funding from AICS and DFID (currently known as FCDO). Within Hobyo district, this action will provide quality lifesaving health services to the following 11 villages Galbarwaako, Elgula Herodhagaxley, Haaro, Afgaduudle, Garday, Qalqaloocan, Biriqoday, Boorweyne, Meygaag dheere, Laasa Hawiye. One Mobile clinic will provide health outreach services in 9 villages hosting a total of 2,790 HHs. The health facilities will be equipped with essential medicines and equipment and staff will be trained to provide quality services. Emphasis will be laid on Maternal and Child Health, including Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) and Expanded Programme on Immunization to IDPs and most vulnerable communities. This project will focus on provision of both curative and preventive health services at primary level integrated with activities addressing GBV and protection needs. Emphasis will be laid on application of standard treatment guidelines as per EPHS at PHC. Building the capacity of health workers through training on Covid-19 case management and infection control, Integrated Management of childhood illness (IMCI), BEmONC will be done to equip health workers with pertinent skills to deliver quality health care services to the affected population. Selected staff will be trained on surveillance for epidemic diseases to allow monitoring of alert thresholds for prompt initiation of response. This will be achieved in collaboration with the MoH at subnational health cluster level. This action will deliver comprehensive reproductive health care to women of reproductive age among the target beneficiaries and promotion of health seeking behaviour including adoption of preventive practices through campaigns, health and hygiene education sessions. Health and hygiene promotions will mostly be done by trained 11 CHWS and 2 hygiene promoters. Cesvi will also integrate surveillance and emergency preparedness ensuring adequate stocks for epidemic outbreaks of AWD/Cholera and measles are prepositioned. Moreover, Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) will be purchased for frontline Health workers as a measure for infection prevention and control (IPC) at service provision points. The project will also contribute to strengthening early warning disease surveillance through weekly submission of CSR reports from all the functional supported health facilities. To this end, the project will establish 2 Rapid Response Teams which will be dispatched to investigate and undertake prompt response in case of emergency and epidemic outbreaks. Referral system for patients seeking secondary healthcare services will be done to Galkayo hospital and will be strengthened with focus on pregnant women requiring emergency services, victims of gun shots, casualties from accidents, trauma cases among others. The project will also undertake confidential identification of GBV survivors for provision of comprehensive care and psychosocial support in-line with IASC MHPSS standard. Clinical management of rape (CMR) will also be provided in the 2 Health facilities. Children aged below 5 years and PLWs with acute malnutrition will be referred to nutrition centers for nutrition care and rehabilitation. Finally, CESVI will coordinate with Health and Nutrition, WASH and FSL clusters to coordinate response activities for maximum impact to beneficiaries.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. Food security is expected to worsen. The project is in line with Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) Standard Allocation and will provide integrated life-saving emergency primary health care and nutrition needs of flood-affected women, men, boys and girls of proposed project targets in Buuhoodle district. NODO is proposing 12-month integrated Health and Nutrition project targeting the most affected populations in Buuhoodle district reaching a total of 15,250 persons including 11,200 women, 1,500 Men, 1,350 girls and  1200 boys)

Health: The proposed project will support 3 static and 1 mobile IERT centres in Buuhoodle district. NODO plans to deliver an integrated package of promotive, preventive and curative maternal, newborn amp child health services and scale-up outbreak early warning and response and case management of epidemic prone diseases through IERT response team as part of the efforts to support the flood affected communities in Buuhoodle. The project aims to maintain the static and mobile clinics in Buuhoodle IDP and host community&#x2019;s sites and scale up the health care through skilled health professionals. NODO through this project will provide regular medical supplies and life-saving drugs to established health facilities, establish referral mechanisms and improve the coverage of measles vaccinations, support safe motherhood and reproductive health while also ensuring readiness to prevent and respond to outbreaks such as malaria, measles or AWD/Cholera and promote health update through health education and beneficiary sensitization

Nutrition: The proposed nutrition activities will be integrated with the health interventions with the aim of addressing underlying causes of high levels malnutrition as well as to enable early identification of SAM cases for treatment  1 mobile and 3 fixed in targeted IDPs and host community in the most affected areas in Buuhoodle district. This program will establish a strong community network through competent community nutrition volunteers for early detection/case finding and referral of children and pregnant and lactating mothers with acute malnutrition. In addition to the treatment of acute malnutrition, the project will be promoting positive infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practice by providing IYCF promotion and counselling. NODO is strong partner for the nutrition cluster and therefore, will have close coordination with other partners in the district for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses. Through this project, a total 15,250 most affected individuals in Buuhoodle will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated health and nutrition services for twelve months&#x2019; period. The mobile team will provide comprehensive community screening, identification, treatment and referral services from community, IDP areas to the fixed OTP and SC to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing rapid referral of the most critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant and lactating women), it shall also capacity building of nutrition staff on IMAM, infant young child feeding best practices, IYCF. Referral of malnourished children with complicated cases will be done to the OTP integrated with PHC services managed by NODO and other actors in the program areas thus providing more holistic opportunity to the target beneficiaries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased Access to Community- and Facility-Based Nutrition Services to strengthen the Resilience of Children and Families in Karan and Yaqshid districts, Banadir Region, Somalia.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mercy-USA&#x2019;s strategic interventions will ensure increased access to nutrition services and expanded coverage through 4 fixed facilities, 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team), and community levels. This three-pronged approach is part of Mercy-USA&#x2019;s strategy to respond to populations&apos; immediate and medium-term needs under distress by supporting the local health facilities and the Ministry of Health capacity to implement nutrition interventions in line with nutrition guidelines available. Specifically, this nutrition program will promote access to quality care, adequate nutrition, and encourage healthier behaviors to optimize the communities&#x2019; resilience to future nutrition emergencies. 
Mercy-USA for Aid and Development, in partnership with the MoH, will continue to address the nutrition challenges by implementing the integrated package in 2 fixed facilities in Karan district and 2 fixed facilities and 5 outreach sites (1 mobile team) in Yaqshid district in Banadir region.
Facility and community-based Basic Nutrition Services Package (BNSP) will cover both curative and preventative interventions targeting children under 5 years old (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women.
Mercy-USA will ensure that the nutrition sites will receive uninterrupted therapeutic/supplementary food supplies. Mercy-USA will provide staff, technical capacity building for staff, and additional monitoring to ensure compliance with nutrition protocols. 
Mercy-USA will train all nutrition staff on SAM and MAM diagnosis and management. Mercy-USA will provide regular joint supervision of the health facilities with MoH and offer refresher trainings to staff.
This program will promote optimal nutrition and IYCF practices that are beneficial to child survival and development by focusing on the promotion, support, and protection of EBF for children and appropriate complementary feeding to build resilience and the nutrition status of infants lt6 months (through EBF) and children 6-24 months. Mothers with children lt6 months will receive messages specific to Exclusive Breastfeeding while mothers with children 6-24 months will receive messages on breastfeeding and complementary feeding. 
Screening for malnutrition among children lt5 and PLW will be conducted primarily at the community level though this screening will also occur at the health facilities by nutrition staff. Malnourished women and children will be admitted in the relevant OTP or TSFP programs. 
According to IMAM guidelines, children in the nutrition program will receive relevant micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A. Women in prenatal care will receive treatment for anemia if required as well as micronutrient supplementation, and postnatal women will be supplemented with Vitamin A and treatment of anemia if required. Additionally, all children admitted in the nutrition program will receive deworming drugs and relevant89` micronutrient supplementation such as iron/folate and Vitamin A.
Serious vaccine-preventable diseases are still prevalent in Somalia. Mercy-USA will thus support the provision of routine EPI activities. This will continue to increase immunization coverage among women and children lt5 years. IDPs, nomadic groups and remote or difficult to access communities are most at risk of missing out on routine EPI. Therefore, Mercy-USA will facilitate outreach nutrition and EPI teams to serve the people who are far from the facilities.
Additionally, Mercy-USA will screen everyone entering a healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and ensure all the preventive and control measures. Although screening for symptoms will not identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals with COVID 19 infection, symptom screening remains an important strategy to identify those who could have COVID-19 so appropriate precautions can be implemented.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved access to prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition of children under 5 and PLW from IDPs, and vulnerable host communities in Heliwa and Kahda districts in  Banadir Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed emergency nutrition interventions will provide integrated lifesaving treatment for acute malnutrition in the targeted districts of Heliwa and Kaxda through facility and community- based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) targeting children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). The proposed project aims to increase coverage and access to the management of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition (MAM/SAM), vitamin A supplementation and deworming as well as promotion of optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. SOS will adopt an expansive IYCF in Emergencies (IYCF-E) strategy aimed at increasing reach beyond mothers raising infants but also fathers, grandfathers, community leaders, religious leaders, teachers, etc.

The proposed project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative nutrition services through the support of static health and nutrition facilities in Heliwa and Kaxda districts in Banadir region. The project activities will be implemented within SOS hospital in Heliwa and Community health center in Kahda The SOS nutrition teams will provide a systematic identi&#xFB01;cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated nutrition services to OTS, TSFP and Stabilization centers. The provision of OTP services for those children with SAM and the referral and treatment of SAM cases with medical complications to the SOS stabilization centre in Heliwa and other SCs in the nearest location in Kahda district. Micronutrient supplementation, promotion of IYCF practices, promoting the adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female prioritizing the disabled children to benefit from the nutrition services. The nutrition interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality in the target districts. 

  Furthermore, the intervention will also provide child protection awareness creation on COVID 19 and adopt WHO and UNICEF IEC risk communication and print it in local language- Somali as well general awareness child protection prevention messages. The project will also ensure frontline health workers are well equipped and protected by distributing Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) including facemasks, handwashing facilities, hand sanitizers, soaps, gloves, etc.

Finally, SOS will carry out the proposed activities in an integrated manner with other sectors such as Health, Food Security, WASH and Child Protection to promote synergy, and to address the underlying and root causes of acute malnutrition. Effects will be made to prevent occurrence of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) by collaborating with available mechanisms in the target locations. Gender mainstreaming will be fully ensured in the community mobilization events, service provision and for the training of staff and other project stakeholders. Data for the beneficiaries will be disaggregated by age and sex. SOS will promote full participation of women, girls and boys, in the project planning, monitoring and implementation to promote their voices are heard and are taken into account including communication preferences. A particular focus will be given to ensure participation of people with special needs or with disabilities by targeting 10% of the total target population in both districts.

At the end of the project, SOS will provide the following interventions
	Screening of 10903 children (4361 boys, 6542 girls) and 826 PLW for acute malnutrition 
	Treatment of 7268 children MAM and SAM 
	Treatment of 1000 SAM with complication 
	IYCF counselling and promotion messages
	MNS 
	Capacity building of staff, MOH/BRA and CNWs</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated management and prevention of Acute Malnutrition to reduce morbidity and mortality in children less than five years as well as PLW in priority gap areas in Lasanod District of Sool region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite marginal improvements from &#x2018;critical&#x2019; levels in the overall nutrition situation in Somalia, malnutrition rates among children remained precarious at &#x2018;serious levels. Of concern were populations with critical prevalence of acute malnutrition above the threshold of 15 per cent, mainly in Northern Inland Pastoral Livelihood Zone (Lasanod District), as well as internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to food insecurity, high morbidity, low immunization and Vitamin-A supplementation, and poor care practices. ANPPCANSOM emergency response plan will scale up treatment of malnutrition and reach an estimated caseload of 1,407 SAM representing 50% of the nutrition cluster SAM burden of 2,806 in Lasanod District. 
The project will provide facility-based and community based (BNSP) covering both curative and preventative interventions targeting children U5 years (boys and girls) and pregnant and lactating women. It will support the identification, referral and treatment of children suffering from moderate and severe acute malnutrition while SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to the Lasanod Stabilization Center run by MSF using standard referral forms. ANPPCANSOM will support and manage 3 health centers (Tuulo Samakaab, Halhaliye, Dan )and 2 mobile teams  covering 20 remote sites (Biriqodey, Bixin, Burowadal, Buulal, Fardhidin, Gacandar, Garac Lagu Dhal, God Qaboobe, Higlo Fiqi, Faleeryale  Canjiid, Laas Magugle, Jidbaale, Kalax, Sango Jabiye, Karin Dabayl, Saha Gebogebo, Buq-Xaar, Adhicadeeye, Akuule) within Lasanod district. 
In order to ensure the sustainability of nutrition interventions, local technical capacity will be strengthened by integrating SAM management into the Primary Health Care system through the functional MCHs. Additionally, the capacity of nutrition staff will be strengthened for effective service delivery at facility and community level. 
ANPPCANSOM will maintain treatment outcomes consistent with Sphere standards using the combined protocol for the management of acute malnutrition in close consultation and coordination with Somalia Nutrition Cluster, Somaliland Nutrition Working Group and other nutrition partners including MOHD, UNICEF and WFP. ANPPCANSOM will build on and sustain the delivery of a holistic basic nutrition services package (BNSP) in priority to the target communities including internally displaced people and their host communities and other socially marginalized groups in pastoral and hard to reach in Lasanod district areas while ensuring the inclusion of treatment, promotion and prevention components in this project. 
The project will support community mobilization and screening as well as micro-nutrient supplementation for PLW (multiple micro-nutrients and Iron folate) and Vitamin A supplementation for children between 6-59 months. It will also provide de-worming for children 12-59 months and pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as counselling and promotion on infant and young child feeding compounded with health and hygiene promotion. Moreover, measles immunization will be provided to infants living within the catchment areas of the target health centers who are not immunized against measles. Systematic defaulter tracing for immunization services will also be conducted at community level. 

In order to strengthen the accountability with affected population, we will introduce mother-led MUAC approach to increase detection, identification and early referral of malnourished children. ANPPCANSOM will train mothers to use MUAC tapes to enable mothers screen, detect oedema and self-referral of their children to nutrition sites.
Likewise, the project will give particular emphasis on the current COVID-19 pandemic prevention measure to contain the spread of the virus. Gender and protection activities will be effectively mainstreamed into the project. Every effort will be made to ensure equity and to reach the most vulnerable population in Lasanod District.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated lifesaving Nutrition project aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality related to acute malnutrition among the most vulnerable in Dhobley, Afmadow district,Lower Juba.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FSNAU 2020 post Deyr assessment indicates both GAM and SAM are serious with aggravating factors.  Food security is expected to worsen. The poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains led to the inadequate pasture, water resources and below average crop production. Weather predictions point towards a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall from April to June due to the La Nina effect. 
The key issues for children and women remain access to prevention and treatment interventions in the absence of a fully functional and stable health system. Tied to that is scarce availability of health professionals and poor community literacy levels (UNICEF 2019 OCHA 2020). Malnutrition is one of the key issues affecting children 6-59 moths and significantly contributing to mortality, considering relationship between malnutrition and disease. 
Services in Dhobley barely reach rural areas because of poor infrastructure . Therefore poor performing indicators like: Poor IYCF, low latrine coverage,low immunization coverage, severe food shortages and poor coverage of nutrition service/health facility are reported (WHO,2020SARA ,2016 FSNAU,2021).  Water shortage has already been reported in Dhobley with population displaced due to water shortage. This is expected to get worse if the predicted La Nina manifests next month (OCHA, 2021)
Women and children urgently need integrated services targeting prevention and treatment of both moderate and severe acute malnutrition.  WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project by WFP that focuses on treatment of moderate acute malnutrition ( MAM) and maternal, child health and nutriton (MCHN) at health facilities . These services have not integrated treatment of  severe acute malnutrition (SAM) therefore children with SAM  are left untreated and so at risk of death. WFP funded project also lacks key primary prevention interventions like Micro nutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and PLW, de worming and IYCF support. Integrating these services will  contribute to significant reduction in prevalence of malnutrition and related mortality.
The project will apply the grant strategy and help achieve cluster objective 2 of providing life saving interventions especially for those affected by drought like conditions. It focuses on scaling up and fully integrating nutrition interventions that will ensure full treatment of acute malnutrition.The proposed project will link to SHF&apos;s 2021 allocation strategy, the fund&apos;s strategic objectives and cluster specific objectives. We hope this will bring down the effects of the prevailing triple threat of COVID 19, floods and Desert Locusts , in addition to the most recent predicted La Nina, on acute malnutrition state. 
WRRS is currently implementing a nutrition project funded by WFP that covers treatment of Moderate acute malnutrition, MCHN and a relief project. The proposed project will bring in treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition thus ensuring full treatment of acute malnutrition at one stop. Beneficiaries will not be referred to other facilities and/or partners, which sometimes complicates treatment by increasing defaulters. This project will also support primary prevention interventions not covered by WFP project, which are very vital. These will include Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) support and micro nutrient supplication for both children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). This proposed project seeks to scale up and integrate treatment of acute malnutrition through a fixed site in Dhobley,being in a health facility. which will of will offer TSFP for treatment of MAM,OTP for treatment of  uncomplicated SAM and Stabilization center for treatment of complicated SAM, all these with prevention interventions. There will also be 1 mobile team to cover IDP  and hard to reach rural areas with treatment of MAM and uncomplicated SAM integrating  prevention interventions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide immediate lifesaving Basic Nutrition Service Package support to &amp;lt;5 children boys, girls, and pregnant and
lactating women in Ceelwaaq district of Gedo region,</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to FSNAU Post Deyr 2020/ technical assessment, the overall health, food security and nutrition needs remain significant within most parts of Somalia with an estimated. In Ceelwaq nutrition situation of district continues to deteriorate further with limited humanitarian assistance. Post day 2020 released by FSNAU in Februar 2021 indicated that a chronic high level of acute malnutrition in Elwak district. The target areas have many challenges contributing to acute malnutrition particularly rural areas where access is constrained. The Desert Locust has caused significant damage to 2020 pastures and grassing land for livestock&#x2019;s which the backbone liveliho of communities in Ceelwaq. The latest forecasts indicate that Desert Locust continues to pose a very high risk to rural livelihoods across Somalia in 2021, potentially exacerbating the impact of the anticipated below-average 2021 Gu rains. The Nutrition Cluster estimates caseloads of about 300 SAM and 2120 MAM annually in the Ceelwaq district with an estimated population of about 30,689 population PESS. HDC is an active nutrition/health partner and currently implementing EAC simplified protocol in partnership with UNICEF as well HIV-Global fund emergency health in Ceelwaq general hospital, Dhamasa and Hosqurun MCHs in Ceelwaq district. In Decembe 2020, UNICEF emergency projects, Covid 19, emergency primary health and implementation of the expanded admission criteria of acute malnutrition to the outpatient therapeutic program EAC that supported health and nutrition intervention in Ceelwaq district implemented by HDC came to a end. This left a gap in health and nutrition in three-way district. The Proposed project will therefore bridge the major essential nutrition service gap that currently exists in Ceelwaq following the ended UNICEF and HDC PD out of the integrated health and nutrition Project. The project will address the identified gaps in nutrition, enhancing access to nutrition services within their localities aimed at improving the physical and mental well-being of boys, girls, men and women in the targeted locations. These specific needs have been outlined in the HRP and FSNAU and UNOCHA mulita cluster need rapid assessment gaps identified in the targeted locations. The proposed project is geared towards reducing the vulnerability of the beneficiaries and communities. HDC will work with MOH-Federal, JSS-MOH to address the nutrition gaps identified. The services will be both preventive and curative targeting vulnerable men, women, boys, girls, and persons living with physical disabilities in the targeted district. 2 Mobile and outreach implementation models will be adopted to address the needs of vulnerable beneficiaries in remote and geographically isolated and hard to reach populations in Ceelwaq district. Screening for malnutrition will be carried out and children with MAM will be treated in OTP sites. Children with MAM will be referred to HDC Managed district hospital supported by UNICEF before but still functional supporting by HDC. Children diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with medical complication will be referred to the SCs that HDC propose to support in Ceelwaq district hospital and Damase referral health center in Ceelwaq district. However, we are facing a shortage of funding to sustain the existing nutrition services. Through this project, HDC is planning to maintain and support the existing nutrition services (2 fixed OTP, 1 stabilization center in the Ceelwaq general hospital with integration of health projects and one mobile teams into reaching 6 villages comprising IDPs and Hard to reach rural population mostly affected by crises in Elwak district. This nutrition intervention will build on HDC&apos;s ongoing emergency nutrition and health interventions in high risks areas in Ceelwaq district and will support the continuation of essential life-saving treatment in the context of COVID and other ongoing outbreaks in line with IMAM guideline.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved, well-coordinated gender sensitive and quality child protection services for Boys and girls including adolescents, children with disabilities facing life-threatening risks of abuse, neglect, violence, exploitation, and severe distress in Luuq.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the beginning of 2020, additional shocks, extensive floods, desert locust infestations, the COVID-19 pandemic and drought have had compounding effects, further deteriorating already compromised systems and gains that had already been made in the economy. The secondary impacts have impacted directly the well-being of children with the rise of negative coping mechanisms being witnessed and reported such as rise in child marriage, psychological distress, sexual violence and other harmful practices. According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview (2021) children and adolescents in Somalia are targets of killing, maiming and abduction, recruitment into armed groups, detention, sexual and physical violence. Boys are at an elevated risk of recruitment to armed groups. The actual extent of grave violations of children&#x2019;s rights is higher than what is reported and verified. Separated and unaccompanied children are at heightened risk of various forms of violence, exploitation and abuse. While some have been placed into alternative care arrangements, a large number live alone or in the street. COVID-19 and the drought situation has stretched the foster families providing alternative care to the children. The Child Protection AoR assessment in 2020 carried out among partners also reported that children were expressing aggressive behaviors which point out to psychological distress stemming from the dire living conditions at home. IA recent study conducted by WVI in Luuq and other neighboring districts revealed that the market places, water points were some of the places identified by both IDPs and host communities as unsafe for children. The major child protection concerns identified during this study included child labour, child marriage, school dropout and sexual violence. These results are   corroborated by the education cluster reports that indicated that children are out of school in Gedo region as a result of drought with about 6000 primary school children affected. This project has been designed to respond to these needs through risk mitigation and prevention of violations of children rights and addressing child protection needs through case management. Leveraging on already existing health, WASH and Food and Cash Assistance projects in Luuq, this project&#x2019;s interventions have been designed to synergize efforts to deliver well-coordinated interventions to address the child protection needs. This presence of WVI staff in Luuq and the existing connection with community structures already provides registered vulnerable people groups for this project to build on. Prevention of violations and risk mitigation through a community led process has been factored including capacity building plans for self-protection among the children and their care givers. Awareness raising on the child protection and equipping of care givers with positive parenting skills is provided for to ensure children associated with armed forces and armed groups are safely re-integrated within their households and community.  To increase access to specialized child protection services either directly or through referral, update and dissemination of the referral pathway is one of the key intervention planned for to raise awareness among service providers and the community for quick and timely response. Provision for MHPSS at individual and group level has been created to meet the needs of children across different ages. Home visits will be facilitated by the care givers to meet the needs of children with disability to ensure they are not left out. Child Friendly Spaces as a measure for MHPSS has also been included in the project. COVID-19 control measures of hand washing and provision of masks for the children will be done. Screening before admission will also be done with the CFS being equipped with thermometers. Through these activities, 1300boys, 1650girls, 850men, 1100 women and 354 of persons with disability 50M,60W,122B and122G will be reached.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Support in WASH, Protection, Shelter/NFI and CCCM by DRC, HAPEN, NoFYL and SEDHURO in Belet Xaawo District, Gedo Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at strengthening safe access to multi sectorial services for IDPs and other vulnerable groups in BeletXaawo through integrated Protection, Shelter, CCCM and WASH interventions. Interventions will be implemented jointly by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and Horn of Africa Peace Network (HAPEN), NoFYL and SEDHURO. DRC will implement both general protection and WASH components. While HAPEN will implement Shelter/NFI components, NoFYL will implement CCCM and HLP components while SEDHURO will carry out the Child Protection component. DRC and HAPEN had originally entered into a teaming agreement for the implementation of project but with the approval of NoFYL and SEDHURO as implementation partners, active collaboration and coordination with the two organizations will be explored. The integrated approach by the 4 organizations, will create synergies, utilize agency expertise and community networks to access and provide adequate and quality services to the most vulnerable members of the community. 


The proposed DRC intervention is designed to contribute to the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and the efforts to address the needs of most vulnerable displacement affected communities with a focus on Belet Xaawo district, Gedo region which is a key location targeted by SHF allocation strategy in 2021. The intervention will promote Protection as a central part of programming and will incorporate continuous awareness creation, analysis of protection risks, training amp follow up for effective implementation in line with the Centrality of Protection Strategy 2020-2021 adopted by the HCT in June 2020. Specifically, the project will strengthen the protection of most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men affected by climatic shocks, conflict and COVID-19 by reducing risks and vulnerabilities and increasing community capacities. It will also address needs exacerbated by the ongoing pre-drought conditions as a result of poor rainfall, impact of floods in 2020 and the ongoing locust infestation. The project will employ participatory and community-based and right based approaches as well as age, gender, diversity and inclusion to ensure vulnerable communities receive adequate and quality responses. Key interventions will include protection monitoring and assessments, strengthening of existing referral pathways. Community based mechanisms will be strengthened to prevent and respond to protection concerns. 


WASH activities will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that include improved access to safe water. DRC will carry out rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures, construction of new water infrastructures, water trucking, establishment of gender balanced water management committees, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects, installation of new sanitation facilities (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different sex and disabled groups) in settlements hosting newly displaced population and hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.)
The project will target to reach 30,000 individuals&#x2019; people (7000 men, 8000, women, 7000 boys, 8000 girls).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency Shelter and NFIs in Belet Xaawo District, Gedo Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide  life-saving shelter and NFI kits to IDPs who have not accessed similar support for the last two years in Ajuaran, Jaron, Odaa, Gawido, Malkarie, Idan and Bula Amin camps in Belet Hawa district. The camps have been selected on the basis of need, high proportion of the newly arrived, lack of similar support and accessibility. The needs of the beneficiaries have been identified through a joint rapid needs assessment conducted by HAPEN and DRC in March 2021.

The target population (women, girls, men, boys, elderly and people with disabilities) are living in small makeshift structures made of sub-standard materials that compromise their privacy, physical security and protection from weather extremes. The families lack adequate access to NFIs, having lost them during displacement.

HAPEN will distribute Emergency Shelter Kits (ESKs) and non-food items (NFI) kits to 2333 households, including 230 host households who are equally vulnerable in the interest of Do-No Harm principle and in support of reintegration. An owner-driven approach in the construction of shelters where beneficiaries are assisted and capacitated to undertake the construction. The process will enable them to undertake basic repairs using local materials or rebuild their shelters in future, thus contributing to sustainability of the benefits beyond the project period. On monitoring, Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and Post Construction Monitoring (PCM) will be conducted after distribution of NFIs and ESKs respectively. The exercises will provide beneficiary feedback on project effectiveness and will target 90% of the beneficiaries to ensure proper representation and accuracy.

To ensure accountability, HAPEN will establish community response and feedback mechanisms (CRFM) in the targeted sites. This will be comprised of a CRFM desk and a hotline to offer a channel for beneficiaries to register concerns. 

HAPEN will work closely with local administration to plan distribution points, schedules and instill order during the exercises to minimize protection risks. The timing and locations of all distributions will put the safety of women, girls, boys, elderly, disabled and those with limited mobility into consideration. Distribution exercises will be done within reasonable daylight hours. Distances to distribution sites and facilities provided by the project will be minimal and safe. It will be made clear that support provided by the project will be at no cost to the beneficiaries, hence no favours should be solicited from beneficiaries. COVID-19 prevention measures will be observed at all points where project requires beneficiaries, leaders or partners to gather. In general, the project will address protection risks and inclusion of women, disabled and minorities at all stages.

Community structures including project community committees will play key roles in decision making, implementation and monitoring of activities and will be comprised of men, women and representatives of the disabled and the minority. 

In particular, this project will closely coordinate and harmonize with Protection, WASH, CCCM and Housing, Land amp Property (HLP)  interventions to be implemented by other partners (DRC, SEDHURO and  NOFYL)  in the same district or camps and in general all other initiatives in the district to ensure complementarity. Under the coordination arrangements, organizations implementing different projects will plan together and share information during the selection of beneficiaries to avoid duplication.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving shelter assistance to 6,720 newly arrived and protracted IDPs in Banadir through distribution of Non-Food Items and provision of emergency shelter kits.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the context of protracted humanitarian crisis in Somalia where 3 million people are in need of shelter assistance, AVORD is submitting this proposal  to contribute to improved living conditions in Banadir. The target group will be carefully selected from protracted and newly arrived IDPs in overcrowded settlements at-risk of Covid 19 outbreak. Special priority will be accorded to households in deplorable shelter conditions, the evicted, those who have lost household items and shelter due to disasters, persons with disabilities, female headed households and people from marginalized groups. 

Under the proposed initiative, 1,120 kit-based Non-Food Items (NFIs) will be distributed to 1,120 households (6,720 persons) in Banadir. In-line with shelter cluster standards, each NFI kits will contain core items such as 1 Plastic Sheet, 3 Blankets, 2 Sleeping Mats, 1 Kitchen Set, 1 double Mosquito Net, 1 Solar lamp and 2 Jerrycan with the capacity of 10 liters each. Disbursement of relief items will be need-based, and will be decided in close coordination with the Shelter Cluster to ensure that available stocks are used to respond to crisis and that activities contribute to the attainment of cluster strategic objectives. In addition to NFIs, 1,120 registered households (6,720 will also receive emergency shelters. To ensure complementarity, the same group who received the NFIs will receive the emergency shelters. Site planning will be an integral part of the shelter development process, thus ensuring that adequate separation between individual households exist to provide all-weather access to individual dwellings and facilities. Before construction of emergency shelters, AVORD will closely coordinate with district officials and relevant line ministries at state and national levels to secure land tenure for a minimum of 3 years.   

Full beneficiary details including name, settlement and contact information will be captured to facilitate monitoring activities and ensure that aid is given to those in need. A Post Distribution Monitoring Exercise (PDM) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the response and document lessons learnt. 

In the delivery of the proposed package, AVORD will seek integration with own interventions in Banadir where AVORD is implementing other programs, and with other humanitarian partners to ensure complementarity, value for money and efficiency of the response.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide life-saving and sustainable integrated Health and WASH interventions for vulnerable settlements and communities in Kismayo, Lower Juba</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children (SC) proposes to deliver an integrated package of Health and WASH lifesaving support interventions to most vulnerable settlements and communities (including men, women, boys and girls) in Lower Juba, Kismayo district in a dignified manner. These interventions are based on the 2021 allocation strategy paper, 2021 Jubaland Drought Risk Assessment findings, and the proposed activities are well aligned with the Health and WASH cluster priorities.
The project aims to improve access for health services to mitigate, control and manage outbreaks (waterborne diseases) and filling critical gaps, while also addressing safe water and sanitation provision through emergency/ lifesaving WASH interventions and enhancing better hygiene practices in Kismayo district. This project will reach 22,000  beneficiaries (men: 5,060, women: 5,500, boys:5,500 , girls: 5,940) over nine (9) months.
The health component will seek to support two (2) mobile health teams to ensure provision of emergency and essential primary health care services with emphasis on waterborne disease mitigation, control and management. SC will support the mobile health teams to provide emergency reproductive health services for underserved with referral pathways established for Gender Based violence (GBV) and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) linkages. Provision of essential medication and supplies (including Personal Protective equipment (PPEs) and COVID-19 related supplies) will be ensured for the mobile teams with well-integrated patient safety protocols as well as accessibility and accountability mechanisms. SC will also support provision of essential routine immunization services. To ensure preventative measures for diseases and outbreaks, SC will actively support community engagement and health education (with integrated hygiene messages) to community members of different sex, age and disability groups in a dignified manner.
For the WASH component, SC plans to conduct water trucking through vouchers to 8,889 drought affected settlements, rehabilitate 5 shallow wells, and 1 extension of existing water infrastructure. The project will also increase access to communal latrines and hand-washing with soap through construction of 56 culture sensitive latrines while addressing specific needs of different sex and disability groups to ensure safety and easy access to facilities. Additionally, beneficiaries of the water and sanitation and health services will be sensitized on hygiene promotion measures with a focus on proper hand washing with soap, safe waste and excreta disposal and household (HH) water treatment and safe storage, distribute 3666 hygiene kits including female specific hygiene items (sanitary clothes, etc.) to vulnerable households and build community resilience and increase sustainability of WASH services by enhancing the capacity of village level WASH management committees to manage, operate and maintain WASH facilities.
The project is designed to ensure equitable access to WASH services by older people and those with disabilities, safety of children and dignity and privacy for women and girls. Coordination with health and WASH clusters at national and state levels will be maintained, in addition to ongoing coordination with general key actors in Lower Juba. The project will address gender issues through collecting sex and age disaggregated data which will be analyzed to identify gaps, provide gender sensitive interventions and ensure participation and empowerment of women. Protection of beneficiaries will be ensured during access and utilization of services seeking to reduce further risks.
SC aims to increase access to clean and safe drinking water, sanitation and improve hygiene knowledge and promote the adoption of safe hygiene practices among the communities, contributing to a reduced risk of disease outbreak and acute needs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute needs among most vulnerable settlements and communities (including men, women, boys and girls) in Burhakaba a dignified manner</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in Somalia is deteriorating due to the devastating impact of flooding, desert locust infestation, the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflict About 5.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, an increase from the 5.2 million reported in 2020. Up to 2.7 million people are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse and will face acute food insecurity through mid-2021. An estimated 840,000 children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, 143,000 of them severely and at risk of death. According to Somalia HNO for 2021 the protracted crisis in Somalia, compounded by COVID-19, floods and droughts, has resulted in massive challenges in meeting the WASH needs of the Somali population. According to the JMCNA, approximately 8.9 million people are affected by poor WASH conditions. For 2021, it is estimated that 4.6 million people are in catastrophic (10 per cent), severe (9 per cent) or extreme (18 per cent) need of humanitarian WASH assistance. The 10 per cent of households in catastrophic need mainly face a lack of access to water both in terms of quality and quantity, accompanied by a lack of access to functional sanitation. It is also a cause of relapse for acute diarrheal diseases when treated patients and children return to their communities with limited safe water and sanitation coverage, resulting in limited sustainability of health programs.
According to assessment conducted by BTSC in Nov,2020 findings revealed that majority of the households (63.3%) use unsafe water from a water catchment or a dam as their primary source for drinking water and the said dam has dried up and the cost of 200 litters of water is currently costing between $3-$4 US Dollars which is not affordable to the drought affected communities. Additionally, 43.5% of sampled households do not treat drinking water. The assessment also revealed that only 45% of the resident do have access to latrines and 98% of those latrines are not accessible to people with disabilities. only 37.5% of the assessed families reported to have access to soap.
In the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through water trucking to 10,000 drought affected population in priority sites /settlements/ communities targeting in Bay(Burhakaba). Rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures one borehole and 6 shallow wells with hand pump. (2) Construction of water infrastructures including construction of tanks and distribution networks, hybrid solar water pumping system in Burhakaba Borehole (Site selection should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions).

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The impact of the ongoing drought compounded by economic and social impacts of COVID-19 escalated conflict and forecast of below-average Deyr rainfall from April to June 2021 may result in further deterioration of humanitarian outcomes for affected communities. Thus, in this project, AADSOM will improve access to safe water, sanitation facilities and promote good hygiene practices to reduce the negative impacts of the flood followed by drought in the Jalalaqsi district to 15,000 women, men, boys, and girls including people with disabilities, minorities and most vulnerable underserved and/or hard to reach communities from 5 villages under Jalalaqsi namely Doondheere, Raafey, Habar robe, Cadiley, Sheeloow, Dirggoys east, Buulo Barwaaqo, Baqdaad east and Jalalaqsi town. Key activities AADSOM would like to undertake within this project are the following WASH services:
Water:
- Provision of safe water to 1,000 households representing 6,000 men, women and children affected population through water vendors (water trucking) by using Water Voucher (WV) for a period of 45 days. (Site of the distribution selection by the women/girls should aim at reducing the risk of violence against women and children accessing water sources through their participation in discussions).

- Construction of 5 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps in 5 villages in Jalalaqsi district, (Baqdad east, Dirgoys east, Raafey, Dondheere, and Bulo Barwaaqo) with special consideration on disabled and child-friendly accessibility.
- Upgrade one borehole in Jalalaqsi town (Amaana Borehole) Howlwadaag section of Jalalaqsi town, equipped with the hybrid system including rehabilitation of existing water tank, construction of water kiosk for human use, Construction of engine room, and piping network.
- Establishment and capacity building training to gender-balanced 6 WASH committees and 12 Well Operators shared equally by men and women, to ensure continuity of service, operation, and maintenance, coupled training on DDR and conflict resolution mechanisms as cross-cutting.

Hygiene and Sanitation:
Lack of access to adequate and appropriate sanitation and hygiene poses a serious threat to public health. The practice of open defecation is a leading cause of fecal-oral transmission of diseases with children being the most vulnerable. A safe and appropriate latrine accompanied by handwashing with soap provides an effective barrier to the transmission of diseases. The provision of appropriate facilities for defecation is also an essential response for people&#x2019;s dignity, safety, health, and well-being. To improve safe access to sanitation it is necessary to meet standards of privacy and safety of women and girls against GBV using sanitation structures that are locally or culturally acceptable. nevertheless, the disabilities will be given a special design that is appropriate and acceptable for use. in this project, AADSOM will: 

- Conduct comprehensive hygiene promotion compounded with covid-19 awareness campaigns to reach 15,000 men, women, boys, and girls through visiting house to house, schools, health, and feeding centers. 
-Train 10 community hygiene promoters (5 men and 5 women), who will carry out hygiene promotion activities during and after the project is faced out. 
-Distribute 500 HP kits to 500 households with vulnerable men, women, and children, and
- Construct 58 gender-sensitive and flood-proof latrines aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the latrines during floods to the most affected community including 5 latrines especially constructed for disabled people.
To  strengthen the local markets-Based Programming (MBP) approach AADSOM will ensure that:
- The service providers should be selected locally if available.
- The contracted service providers should purchase the required material and equipment in the local market if available.
- The contracted service provider should hire skilled and skilled workers from the local people.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing life-saving and sustainable WASH services to undeserved IDP and host communities affected by drought in Ceelberde  District of Bakool Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia&#x2019;s prolonged humanitarian crisis is characterized by ongoing conflicts, climate-related shocks, communicable disease outbreaks, and weak social protection mechanisms. Since the beginning of 2020, three additional shocks have contributed to a deterioration of humanitarian conditions: Extensive floods, Desert Locust infestations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These compounding shocks have exacerbated humanitarian needs among a population already living under the strain of widespread poverty and decades of armed conflict and insecurity. Climate change continues to be a major contributing factor to displacement and food insecurity in Somalia.
Increasingly erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions and floods, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Flooding displaced 919,000 people in 2020 and destroyed essential infrastructure, property, and 144,000 hectares of agricultural land. a serious lack of access to clean water and sanitation is heightening the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases exacerbating existing fragilities, especially where health services are too few and/or too distant. In this project, ARD is aimed to improve access to WASH services for Ceelberde IDPs, host communities with recognition of people of disabilities, and the most vulnerable population through the provision of safe water drinking with water vouchers for 60 days period,. Construction/rehabilitation of 22 flood-proof shallow wells with hand pumps, benefiting around 11,000 (2500 men, 5700 women, 1400 girls, and 1400 boys) crisis-affected IDPs and host communities will be under taken. ARD will also construct 50 flood-resistant latrines to benefit residents in the Ceelberde IDP sites which will also receive the clean water and hygiene promotions and hygiene kits. Approximately, 10% of the 50 latrines (corresponding to 5) will be preserved for people with disabilities living in the target locations. A total of 2500 (500 men, 1500 women, 250 girls, and 250 boys) people will benefit from access to the sanitation, 1000 Households will benefit from hygiene kit distribution and hygiene awareness, Chlorination of wells and WASH committees will be established in addition, carry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Ceelberde district,</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan is one of the most complex humanitarian operating environments. Humanitarian needs are dispersed across the country, often in areas very difficult to access due to geographical remoteness, lack of infrastructure, and insecurity. According to the last South Sudan Humanitarian Access Severity Overview released by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in November 2019, difficult physical environment, including poor road conditions, was the most prevalent access challenge reported by partners.

Since July 2020, humanitarian needs in the country have dramatically increased due to unprecedent rainfalls leading to floods along the White Nile. OCHA reports over 866,0000 individuals are affected with 389,000 individuals having been displaced by the floods (OCHA: South Sudan: Flooding Snapshot as of 21-Oct-2020). The floods hit a population experiencing years of conflict, make them more vulnerable famine and hunger as well as water borne disease outbreaks. Key immediate needs include food, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter and non-food items (SNFI), and health and nutrition services. A time effective and sustained humanitarian response requires humanitarian operational bases from which the flood-affected populations can be reached.

In October 2020 OCHA cited conflict, access, COVID-19, funds and lack of facilities from which humanitarian organizations can operate as the major gaps and challenges to the flood response.  Lack of operational bases with safe and adequate office and accommodation spaces for humanitarian agencies&#x2019; staff is a serious impediment to the humanitarian response particularly in the proposed project locations.

An inter-agency assessment in September 2019, identified the need for expansion of static and temporary humanitarian hubs in order to reach hard-to-reach populations.  


The objective of this project is to enable a humanitarian response to the floods by establishing two humanitarian hubs in Jonglei State which has the highest number of flood-affected people in South Sudan.

IOM proposes to establish a humanitarian hub in Jiech (Ayod County) and a light base camp in Pibor (Pibor County), both in Jonglei. 

Each of the proposed humanitarian hubs will accommodate approximately 15 to 20 humanitarian staff. Humanitarian agencies working from these hubs will be enabled to reach approximately 57,529 individuals in Ayod County and 95,835 individuals in Pibor County with life-saving WASH, SNFI, and health and nutrition services (targeted figures based on IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix as of 02 November 2020).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Flood response through Shelter and NFIs  in Bor South, Pibor and Ayod areas of Jonglei State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 6 months&#x2019; project will focus on &apos;&apos;Providing access to emergency shelter and lifesaving non-food items to the flood displaced people in Bor South, Pibor and Ayod Counties of Jonglei State from November 2020 to April 2020. The project will reach 61,000 persons affected by flooding (17,934 men, 18,666 women, 11,956 boys and 12,444 girls) with an estimated total of 2224 persons living with disabilities (4% of the total target).

The project team will distribute 10,166 shelter/NFI kits to the flood affected people. Each kit will include 2 plastic sheets, 2 mosquito nets and 2 rubber ropes at minimum. The distribution of shelter and NFIs will be based on vulnerability criteria, addressing the needs of large families, households with children under 5, pregnant or lactating woman (PLW), unaccompanied elderly (gt 60 years), people living with disability (PLWD), female headed households, child headed households, unaccompanied minors and the chronically ill.

NRC will work through the rapid response team/mobile teams (RRT) supported by NRC static team in Bor South to register and verify beneficiaries, distribution of Survival/shelter kits will be done. The kits shall be requested from core pipeline through the cluster recommendation.

In line with the allocation strategy, the project will ensure inclusiveness and participation ensuring equitable participation. In assessments, distribution committees will be encouraged and supported, while distribution activities will be scheduled to allow for women and girls involvement

The project will promote timely delivery of assistance through deployment of mobile teams in line with humanitarian response priorities for 2020 as outlined in the HRP as well as the flood response in South Sudan. NRC&#x2019;s mobile response teams will be ready for deployment within 8 days to conduct assessments/validation of beneficiaries and within 14 days for full-fledged delivery of NFIs supported by some staff from NRC static office in Bor South.

The project team will work in close coordination with S/NFI cluster, cluster focal points, and its activities will be informed by the gaps identified through the assessment missions carried out by NRC or other actors on the ground or joint assessments. NRC will also coordinate its operations with CIDO, HDC, CRS, PAH, IDEAS South Sudan, South Sudan Red Cross and Health Link among others that are already operational in some of the locations e.g. Bor South.

The specific needs of the persons displaced by floods have shortage of shelter and WASH supplies. Other actors like PAH are responding to the WASH needs and NRC will focus on distribution of  Shelter and NFI kits to meet the shelter needs of men, women, boys and girls. These beneficiaries will be selected  jointly with the community and will put into considerations the minimum standards of protection and shelter due diligence guidelines. 

The project team will ensure that women and girls are not exposed to risk of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) at the distribution points and to have the distribution site within short walking distances from the beneficiaries&#x2019; homes/areas of displacement. In case drinking water is not available in nearby locations, water will be provided by NRC team at the distribution sites. Elderly, physically incapable, pregnant women and others who require special attention will be prioritized during distribution so that they are served early and comfortably. Feedback desk will be provided at each distribution site so that beneficiaries register their complaints with NRC on the entire project process and quality of the supplies/Kits. NRC will conduct post distribution Monitoring (PDM) in at least at 50% in locations of distribution.

The project will be implemented in line with the COVID-19 guidelines ensuring that the staff and beneficiaries ensure social distancing, using face masks and washing ha</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Effective provision of basic life-saving NFIs and Emergency Shelter materials to most vulnerable flood - affected population through In -kind modality to vulnerable communities in Juba (Mangalla) and Awerial counties, south Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under this project, Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH) will provide life-saving emergency shelter materials and life-sustaining non-food items to the most vulnerable populations, focusing on floods &#x2013;affected internally displaced persons, HC and returnees in Juba County, Central Equatoria state  and Awerial county of Lakes state and other priority locations in South Sudan, through mobile response modality lasting up to 6 months which will contribute to the reduction of protection risks and reduce exposure to diseases attributed with poor shelter conditions and lack of non-food items. The Project will support the existing coping mechanisms of the local community. Builds resilience towards other shocks, that have indirect effect (such as the worsening economic situation). Mobile modality will be supported with community awareness on Covid-19 to reduce health and protection risks to women and girls during distribution. Environmental awareness campaigns will also be done including HLP issues.
PAH will conduct in-depth need analysis, verification and distribution with the involvement of protection staff and the participation of the target populations through consultative community meetings, key informant interviews, focus group discussions with men, women, boys and girls, household level and individual interviews, and direct observations conducted by the assessment teams at household level to identify the needs of affected gender, age and diversity groups, the vulnerabilities of the targeted community and coping strategies employed by the affected population. The activities will be planned and implemented jointly with Nutrition, FSL,WASH, Health and S/NFI actors working in Juba and Awerial. PAH will target 42,500 beneficiaries (17,000 IDPs, 14,875 HC and 10,625 returnees 6,800 men,7,650 women, 13,600 boys, 14,450 girls) focusing on female headed households, unaccompanied elderly, people with no links to the community, separated children, women at risk (pregnant and lactating mothers), child-headed households, people living with disability and returnees whose properties were damaged and looted during the conflict.
PAH plans 5 interventions - 3 in Awerial and 2 in Juba. In case of needs reaised in other locations, after cluster recommendation and UN OCHA accept PAH is ready to intervene in other locations. In areas where PAH is dedicated to respond it is reported 87 000 people are affected by the floods (53 000 in Awerial and 34 000 in Juba).
PAH teams will comprise of experienced ES/NFI officers and protection personnel (50% women and 50% men). Two protection officers will participate in interventions with close coordination and collaboration with the Protection Cluster. The team will implement the interventions jointly with other partners&#x2019; particularly static partners, especially ES/NFI, WASH, FSL and Protection actors and in close coordination with the respective clusters (SFPs) and cluster coordinators will be involved in the planning, coordination and reporting of the interventions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency shelter and life-saving Non Food Items within Covid-19 guidelines to vulnerable flood-affected populations in Duk and Twic East Counties in Jonglei state</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has been hit by heavy rains since the start of the long rain season in April 2020. This caused increased water levels on the Nile River and was  compounded by more than normal rainfall in part of East Africa (FAO Rainfall Projection 2020). The affected populations have moved to mostly schools found on higher grounds where they are facing additional health  risks due to lack of food, drinking water, Shelter and living in crowded areas which may expose them Covid 19 (Duk and Twice East IRNA reports of July/August 2020) 

The UN Office for  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported on 03 September that flooding in areas along the White Nile has affected 24 counties in 6 states since July this year. According to OCHA, a coordinated humanitarian response scale-up in the most affected states of Jonglei, Lakes, and Unity was initiated to respond to the increased needs of people affected and displaced by the floodwaters. Touch Africa Development Organization (TADO) operating in Jonglei state with support from SFP/NFI cluster and other implementing partners such as CIDO, HDC, ADA amp PA proposes to contribute to this emergency response through a Shelter and No- food items intervention in Duk (26,000 individuals) and Twic East (15,200 individuals) Counties of Jonglei State.

The intervention and severity of needs for these locations are informed by verified information retrieved from various sources including (UNOCHA, I OM-DTM, and WFP reports ) and coordinated assessment by different partners on the ground in order to respond to the alerts. The proposed project will provide access to emergency shelter and lifesaving non-food items to the flood-displaced people in a timely manner through the deployment of TADO rapid response teams in line with humanitarian priorities outlined in the Humanitarian Response plan 2020 (HRP). 

The project has the overall objective to Provide equitable, dignified, and Covid-19 informed access to emergency shelter amp NFIs to 41,200 most vulnerable flood-affected individuals in Duk amp Twic East Counties of Jonglei State over a 6 month period.

In the pursuit of this objective, the project envisions two outcomes: (1).41,200 most vulnerable flood-affected individuals (17,508 Women, 9,505 Men, 8,409 Girls amp 5,778 Boys) in Duk and Twick East Counties have access to life-saving emergency shelter and non-food items., and (2). Increased awareness and response on cross-cutting issues including gender, protection, and the Covid-19 pandemic among the most vulnerable flood-affected populations in Duk and Twic East Counties. End cycle target beneficiaries include 17,508 women, 9,505 men, 8,409 girls amp 5,778 boys being individuals from Host Communities(8,338), IDPs (26,507), and Returnees (6,355). An estimated 1,385 PWDs are targeted.

The planned activities focus on strengthening Accountability to Affected Populations through the negotiated entry into the communities through recognized community gate-keepers including state authorities, religious leaders, youth leaders, women leaders, and other stakeholders who will be identified and trained to form Beneficiary Accountability Committees (BAC). Project conceptualization, planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation including feedback mechanisms will be done in a participatory manner with the participation of the BACs.
Covid-19 awareness and capacity for responding to cross-cutting issues including gender and protection concerns will be mainstreamed and conducted throughout the project implementation period. Needs assessments, Beneficiary registration and verification, and distribution of NFIs and Emergency Shelter kits will be done collaboratively with the BACs.. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning will be a continuous activity. TADO has specialist staff with the technical capacity and experience to undertake this project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Quality Access to Emergency Live-Saving Shelter and Non Food Items (S/NFIs) to Flood Affected IDPs, Returnees and Vulnerable Host Population through a Single Sector Approach in Rumbek Center and Rumbek East Counties of  Lakes State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims at meeting the immediate need of the newly flood affected population in Rumbek Centre and Rumbek East in Lakes States through provision of life-saving NFI and Emergency Shelter Items to the newly Flood affected households. According to Multi-sectoral IRNA assessment Report (July 7, 2020) conducted in Lakes State, shelter and NFIs has been identified as the most immediate need following the ongoing flush floods (July- October rainy season) that has created a humanitarian crisis to people already affected by high levels of poverty, impact of COVID-19 and yet to recover from effects of previous floods of December 2019. The assessment report indicates that since July at the beginning of the long perennial rains, Rumbek has received unexpected rainfall that has caused serious flooding affecting most the lowland parts of the State. Being flat land Rumbek also receives a lot of water from upstream especially from rivers originated from Ethiopia and Uganda. The effects of the floods are unprecedented and devastating on recently cultivated and crops, livestock and other livelihood options. The Floods have come very early before main cash crops (Ground nuts, Sesame, Beans and Maize) are harvested, soon hunger will crop up. Houses and dwelling are either destroyed or submerged as many people are displaced to higher grounds having lost their personal belongings. Most people who are displaced have no shelter to sleep and thus fears of contracting water born diseases such as malaria and cholera amidst COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, there are still many IDPs living with host communities in the target areas who are yet to resettle from 2019 displacement by floods and communal conflict and who are expected to host new flood displaced people. This has caused burden and displacement of Host Communities while the situation of IDPs situation has been made worse on the other hand. TITI Foundation (TF) is one of the active national NGOs supporting communities in the affected locations plans to provide lifesaving assistance the most vulnerable men, women and children affected by floods. The project builds on the TF&#x2019;s ongoing and planned multi-sectoral project in the area. The target beneficiaries for this project are IDPs, Returnees and the vulnerable Host Communities and number to be reached is 40,300 according the Cluster assigned caseload. 6,716 Households comprised of (14508 Men and 21762 Women), (1612 Boys and 2418 Girls). The project contributes towards resolving the situation of the affected population by supporting them with unimpeded and sustained access to plastic Sheets, and other NFIs as stipulated in the Central Emergency Response Fund Reserve allocation policy, process and standards and will improve the living standard of those targeted with the intervention in question as their need for Shelter and NFIs will have been addressed, maintained or increased hence minimizing incidences of water borne diseases. The mode of delivery of this project is through requisition of the Shelter and NFIs from the core pipeline (IOM) in Juba and Rumbek Town respectively. The items will be prepositioned in the target locations before actual distribution is finally conducted to the beneficiaries. The identification and registration of beneficiaries will be done using NFIs/Cluster approved methodology and will involve community participation through participatorily selected of AAP committee and trained enumerators comprising of male and female. The approved quantities of these items will be transported by heavy and light Trucks to Rumbek Center and Rumbek East storage facilities before they are transported for distribution points in Bomas and Villages. TF will work in close partnership and collaboration with the ESNFIs Sub-Cluster and Partner Organizations on ground (International, National, and Community Based Organizations), Beneficiaries, Community Leaders, Chiefs, Youth and Women Leaders, elderly and People with special needs (PSN)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated emergency nutrition and food security response for flood affected communities in Pibor County.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is being proposed to deliver time sensitive and life-saving services to communities affected by flood emergency in Pibor and who are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance in Pibor County. The proposal seeks to deliver an integrated and multisectoral response that combines nutrition and food security (FSL) interventions to effectively address the needs of 15,000 people over a period of six months. In line with the nutrition cluster response plan, the project targets 4468 beneficiaries ( SAM:783,MAM:2032 and PLWs: 1653 ) with an aim of preventing further deterioration of nutritional situation of children under 5 years and pregnant and lactating women in Pibor ensure continuity of detection and treatment of children under 5 years with SAM and MAM and pregnant and lactating women with acute malnutrition as well as rehabilitate nutrition sites affected by flooding and inter communal conflicts to ensure availability of infrastructure, human resources, and equipment for nutrition service delivery in flood affected areas. Under the Food security and Livelihood (FSL) response component, the project will deliver emergency livelihood inputs to 3,600 flood affected households to restore their livelihood and enhance their own emergency food production. The project will directly distribute critical agricultural inputs such as vegetable seeds and fishing kits and provide extension/training to facilitate their entry into production of nutritious vegetables and fish harvesting. To enhance better integration and synergy with nutrition interventions, the project will train and support 160 members of mother to mother support groups on kitchen gardens and will restore kitchen gardens in all the 16 Outpatient Therapeutic Program (OTP) nutrition sites which were damaged by the recent flooding. The project will be implemented in partnership with other actors in Pibor to maximize synergy and ensure a successful delivery of an integrated flood response. It will collaborate with PLAN international to deliver MAM services to flood affected communities which is currently managing Targeted supplementary feeding Program (TSFP) sites in Pibor work with Health partners to ensure that all children with SAM and children with MAM that have fever will be screened for malaria and positive cases referred to the health staff for treatment. It will further integrate WASH actions into nutrition activities through ensuring that all children with SAM are provided with a take home WASH kit. The project will assign sufficient field staff and closely work with local institutions to ensure accountability to affected community such as to reach the community on regular intervals with key messages and information including on targeting criteria, entitlements, available nutrition service and locations and distribution place and times. JAM will ensure gender balance in recruitment of additional community workers under both nutrition and FSL components. 
The project will be implemented in a COVID-19 sensitive manner. The project will integrate COVID-19 risk communication and awareness through all planned nutrition focused behavioral communication actions, FSL trainings as well as scale up its WASH activities to contribute to the containment of the spread of the disease.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency Nutrition interventions for the flood-affected vulnerable populations (Children 6-59 months, pregnant and lactating women) in Panyijar County of South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps is requesting emergency funding from SSHF to provide critical lifesaving nutrition services to approximately 23,993 people (8,576 males and 15,417 females) affected by the floods in Panyijar County, Unity State. The main objective of this project is to prevent further deterioration of the nutrition status among the severely affected population groups in the county &#x2013; the children under 5 years old and PLW. The proposed nutrition response will focus on the treatment and prevention of acute malnutrition among boys and girls aged 0-59 months and PLWs with acute malnutrition through management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in IMC&#x2019;s nutrition facilities. In addition, the project will support life-saving improvements in Maternal-Infant Young Child Nutrition (MIYCN) practices focusing on the first 1,000 days of a child&apos;s life. 

Through this funding, IMC will also enable to rehabilitate the existing seven static sites, and establish three additional mobile nutrition services delivery points in Panyijar County. These will enable IMC to expand its response capacity to reach more under five children and PLWs who are affected by the flood increase their access to treatment for SAM and MAM, prevent acute malnutrition, and ensure continuity of nutrition services across IMC&#x2019;s nutrition facilities.  Ultimately, this proposed project will ensure timely nutrition services delivery to the flood-affected under five children and PLW regular supply of specialized food to children adequate resources to carry out the response (human, equipment and supplies), and proactive community mobilization (active screening, effective referral and treatment, and behavior change activities) by static and mobile teams. These interventions will be augmented by the ongoing capacity strengthening efforts of IMC at facility and community levels. The duration of this proposed project is for 9 months, from 01 November 2020 to 30 June 30 2021.

IMC will maintain and continue to implement nutrition interventions in the same locations and will scale-up the nutrition services into hard to reach and flood-affected areas. This project will be implemented in nine OTP/TSFP sites (7 static and 3 outreach sites) in Panyijar County. The proposed interventions will complement the ongoing activities funded by UNICEF and WFP, and will benefit from the available resources of IMC in Nyal, such as its office and trained field staff, which will minimize its HR, logistics and distribution costs. It will also leverage on IMC&#x2019;s existing active program cooperation agreement (PCA) with UNICEF and Field level agreement (FLA) with WFP, which will ensure consistency of provision of nutrition supplies for SAM and MAM treatment. Furthermore, IMC will reinforce integration and linkages with other sectors (Health, Food Security, WASH, and Protection) to address the key drivers of malnutrition through enhanced coordination and joint programming targeting vulnerable groups, in coordination with other partners in the area. 

This proposed project will be implemented with full adherence to COVID-19 IPC measures per the WHO, Ministry of Health and Nutrition Cluster guidelines. IMC has also put in place its COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan, which will be adapted for this project, to ensure continuity of its life saving nutrition operations while guaranteeing the safety of staff, partners and beneficiaries. Specifically, IMC will provide training to all its nutrition staff, including Community Nutrition Volunteers and Mother-Support Groups on COVID-19 IPC measures. Additionally, IMC will carry out the following: strengthening its community mobilization efforts on COVID-19 risks and mitigation measures distributing/posting of COVID-19 IEC materials pre-positioning of PPE for staff and training them on its rational utilization, and mounting bigger sheds to ensure physical distancing in waiting areas.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Integrated response to life threatening malnutrition to flood  affected populations in Duk County, Jonglei state, South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the project is to contribute to the reduction in malnutrition related mortality and morbidity, and improve access to high quality lifesaving emergency nutrition interventions for the most vulnerable populations notably U5 children and pregnant and lactating women affected by floods. Therefore, treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition and Moderately Acute Malnutrition for children below five years as well as Pregnant and Lactating Women continues to be one of key need for saving lives of most at risk who are affected by flood in Duk County.

The project will target 647 Severe Acute Malnutrition, 1,680 Moderately Acute Malnutrition and 1,366 Pregnant and Lactating Women respectively in which target of Severe Acute Malnutrition is 647(Male=311, Female=336) while Moderately Acute Malnutrition U5 target will be 1,680(Male=806, Female=874) and Pregnant and Lactating Women target at 1,366 (SSHF Reserved target 2020).
This Allocation will compliment to funding from UNICEF/WFP/OFDA to allow JDF expand services to reach displaced population by flood in Duk. This funding will fill the funding gaps that were not included in UNICEF/WFP/OFDA budget to respond to an emergency situation to help most at risk vulnerable population displaced to the raised ground in bank of canal with live saving intervention. It will also ensure enhanced needs analysis of nutrition situation and robust monitoring and coordination of emergency nutrition responses while increasing access to safe and integrated health and WASH responses due to recent COVID 19 pandemic with support from Home Health Promoters who will work alongside with Community Nutrition Volunteers and Mother to Mother Support groups in Duk County. 

The Reserve Allocation will enable JDF fill the existing gaps by covering the entire county to address the deteriorating nutrition situation through strengthening 4 stabilization Centres, 9 Therapeutic supplementary feeding program/Outpatient therapeutic program sites, 2 Mobile outreach sites in Ayueldit and Amiel. 

Program approaches will include active case detection and treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition /Moderately Acute Malnutrition and preventive intervention through community education, maternal infant young child feeding in emergencies, Mother Mid Upper Arm Circumference Approach, deworming campaigns, and mass screening targeting flood affected communities.
The community outreach component will entails support from Community Nutrition Volunteers and Mother to mother support groups who will conduct awareness creation, mass screening of Children U5, follow up of defaulters and referral of malnourished children to nutrition facilities.
In addition, the project will also support Mother Care group who will be responsible for regularly visiting 10&#x2013;15 of her neighbors, sharing what she has learned and facilitating behavior change at the household level. Care Groups create a multiplying effect to equitably reach every beneficiary household with interpersonal behavior change communication. Mother Care groups will conduct awareness creation, promote mother MUAC mass screening of Children U5, follow up of defaulters and referral of malnourished children to nutrition facilities. 
The Community Nutrition Volunteers, Mother to Mother Support groups and mother care groups will be trained on identification of acute malnutrition within the community through use of Mid Upper Arm Circumference tapes and referral forms. They will also do home follow up for those in the program to support in defaulter tracing and gather information on reasons for absenteeism and defaulting as well as education on key hygiene messages to improve linkages between WASH and nutrition for better health outcomes.
JDF Added values are Integration with Health, Nutrition and WASH Long-standing partnership with CHD and Magna contributing to improved health and Nutrition service delivery for local communities</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CARE Flood response in Pariang, Bor South  Twic East</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July 2020. As at 6 October, an estimated 800,000 people have been affected by the floods in 37 counties with the highest impact being in Jonglei, Lakes and Upper Nile. CARE International in collaboration with other agencies conducted needs assessments in Jonglei and Paring which revealed numerous challenges that people are facing such as the loss of their homes, assets, and access to life-saving services such as protection and health care. CARE would like to embark on a response as follows: 
Component 1: Provision of Protection Services in Bor South and Twic East
Under this component, CARE&#x2019;s aims to provide immediate life-saving GBV response and prevention services to flood affected and displaced people from Twic East and Bor. The project targets to reach out 18770 beneficiaries. To provide emergency GBV assistance, CARE will establish and run 5 temporary WGFSs and women and girls who visits temporary WGFSs will be provided with individual /group PSS along with recreational activities to overcome stress and trauma due to flood and GBV incidents. With regards to case management, to uphold the Do No Harm principle CARE will identify the GBV cases in temporary WGFSs and refer to GBV services with better data protection facilities and more sustainable. In doing so, identified GBV survivors facing financial barriers to access GBV services such as Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) and legal aid will be supported with cash for protection assistance. Two comprehensive referral pathways will be developed and disseminated. Most vulnerable women and girls will be supported with emergency materials such as dignity kit, cooking utensils and emergency cloth set. 10 safety audits will be conducted to identify the protection threats and to inform the project team on specific vulnerabilities, security risks and mitigation plan. Outreach volunteers will be hired, trained, equipped and mobilized to conduct outreach activities. Group awareness sessions and radio series and jingles will promote the preventive approach and provides correct and adequate information on GBV and referrals. Finally, front-line health workers, local authorities, service providers, will be trained on GBV, GBV guiding principles, pocket handbook and COVID prevention measures. 
Component 2: Provision of Health Services in Pariang
Under this component, we aim to provide access to high quality health services that will respond to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the flood affected population of Pariang County. The project will achieve by ensuring that he flood affected population has access to quality emergency health services that meet the Ministry of Health and WHO standards and is supported to access health services where challenges exist e.g. flooded roads by supporting referral services. To achieve its goal, CARE will establish 2 mobile clinics to provide health services to the displaced populations that cannot access the existing health facilities. CARE will also support 6 static health facilities to ensure that they can cope with the high number of patients that they are currently seeing. Training will be provided to all staff involved in the delivery of this project to ensure that quality standards are maintained. Furthermore, medical supplies will be procured and provided to each of the 8 supported health facilities. To ensure that the community is involved in project delivery, CARE will form health committees for each of the health facilities being supported. CARE will also use existing boma health workers, and community health volunteers, opinion leaders and community key informants to reach the most vulnerable populations in the community. CARE will also ensure that all the data generated from the project will be captured in the DHIS 2 and IDSR of the Ministry.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of lifesaving Child Protection Assistance for Flood affected children and families in Duk and Twic East Counties, Jonglei State (CPAF)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is estimated that 80% of the 800,000 people affected by the ongoing floods outbreak in South Sudan are from Jonglei and 14% of them are specifically from Duk and Twic East counties. This is on top of preexisting shocks caused by floods in 2019, perilous intercommunal violence in the two counties and prevailing hyperinflation rates. 52% of the affected populations are children. The floods destroyed homes, crops, cattle and displaced populations to either higher grounds within the county or to other safe locations. Recreational facilities for children such as child friendly spaces, schools, community spaces have also been submerged. This situation is posing unbearable protection risks to children and their families including family separation, psychosocial distress, waterborne diseases, snake bites, drowning, disruptions of family ties and increased gender based violence (GBV) against girls. Such complex crises increase vulnerability level mainly among the already disadvantaged groups of children including the unaccompanied and separated children (UASC), orphaned, child survivors of GBV, sick children, children with disabilities and so forth. 

This project will target 27,500 people affected by floods (13,000 girls, 12,000 boys, 1500 women, and 1000 men) including 2% children with disabilities in Duk and Twic East for 6 months with funding requirement of $500,000. Priority child protection interventions will include case management support for UASC and other vulnerable children (OVC), psychosocial support for children and caregivers, outreaches and messaging on child protection risks associated with flooding, monitoring and reporting on situation of children, support children through referral pathways and services, community based child protection mechanisms and capacity building for frontline staff on child protection approaches in situation of floods, COVID-19, conflicts and other emergencies.

CINA has long-term strong protection presence in Twic East and Duk and will use boats to rapidly access those at most need, displaced by floods to higher grounds, taking into account the CERF criteria. For protection to remain central, CINA will prioritize safety and dignity and avoid causing harm in setting up of safe spaces for children, case managements and risks prevention activities especially in the situations of floods. CINA will provide equitable and impartial access for case management support for the most vulnerable girls and boys. Community complaints and feedback mechanisms, code of conduct as well as PSEA measures will be put in place to ensure accountability to affected populations. Participation of boys, girls, caregivers and community based child protection networks (CBCPN) will be considered throughout the design, implementation and monitoring of project activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving access to critical child protection services and nutritional support for flood affected children and PLWs in Bor South.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SCI will implement an integrated, multi sectoral child protection (CP) and nutrition centered project to provide life-saving protection and nutrition services to affected children and PLWs The project will reach 52,883 people (12,709 girls, 16,231 boys, 18,423 women and 1,620 men) with both CP and Nutrition interventions. CP intervention will target a total of 19, 500 (7700 girls, 7700 boys, 1800 men and 2300 women) and will address the protection and psychosocial concerns of children including UASC through case management, FTR, messaging on flood associated and other protection risks and available services, child protection referral, capacity building for CP actors, and monitoring and reporting on the situation of children. As part of CP and nutrition integration, CP messaging and identification of and support for cases of child neglect will be done at nutrition centres. Nutrition component will target a total of 48,287 (13,676 girls, 12,624 boys, 24 men and 21,963 women): will support institutional health centres to improve access to and quality of CMAM services (TSFP, OTP and SC), by providing quality emergency nutrition services for the most affected people. The project will increase coverage of nutrition services and strengthen health centres though capacity building and material support. Cases of SAM children 6-59 months with medical complications and malnourished children under six months will be identified and treated in the Stabilization Centre at Bor Hospital. Cases of SAM children 6-59 months without medical complications will be identified and treated in OTP. MAM children 6-59 months will be identified and managed in TSFP. Both severe and moderately malnourished PLWs will be identified and managed in TSFP. To improve access to therapeutic feeding centre, SCI will establish one site in flood resettled IDP location to improve accessibility of community in remote areas and avoid unnecessary travel in environment that have transportation gaps that can aggravate insecurity and hence protection  concerns. The project will be implemented in 4 payams: Bor town, Kolnyang, Makuach and Baidit and will coordinate with other interventions/services within SCI and external service providers through networking and referrals. Due to restrictions and impeded access because of COVID-19, the project will adapt planned activities to ensure that vulnerable and risk children and caregivers continue to be reached with essential lifesaving services.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency flood response with WASH and EFSL integrated interventions targeting flood affected population in Rumbek East and Rumbek Center, Lakes State in South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This flood response project will provide emergency WASH and EFSL interventions targeting 42,000 of the flood-affected population, i.e. 7,000 Households (ICCG report, October 2020) in Rumbek East and Rumbek Center counties within Lakes state, South Sudan. These communities have been affected by flooding since July 2020. The impact of the floods has varied, with some families having lost their homes after these were submerged, while others lost valuable assets to the floods but have been able to remain close to, or in, their homes. Lakes state is among the flood affected counties which also includes Jonglei, Unity, Central and Western Equatoria and Upper Nile states. This flooding comes barely a year after another round of devastating floods in the same locations in 2019. According to the ICCG report of 12th October 2020, a total of 42,000 people in the two counties require immediate humanitarian assistance. The floods have destroyed homes and forced people to move to higher grounds. The outwards migration from the flood-affected areas into other neighboring locations has increased pressure on existing services in those locations, hence increased deterioration of the humanitarian situation.

This project will provide emergency assistance in WASH and EFSL, as per the Second Reserve Allocation, towards reducing morbidity, mortality and suffering among the most vulnerable populations and facilitate safe, equitable and dignified access to critical basic services to enable populations to meet their basic needs. This will include improving access to adequate and safe water, appropriate sanitation, solid waste management and raise awareness related to good hygiene practices and behavior through dissemination of hygiene messages. The emergency WASH assistance will involve distribution of point-of-use/household level water treatment chemicals and storage containers to targeted households which have no access to safe water sources. Water quality monitoring and testing will be carried out by trained Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) targeting free residual chlorine in water at the point-of-use and faecal coliform contamination. Good hygiene practices will be promoted through distribution of hygiene and dignity/Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) kits, COVID-19 risk communication, hygiene awareness raising and dissemination of messages through available media, house-to-house visits and campaigns by the community structures which include CHPs, Community Health Volunteers (CHVs), community leaders and WASH and Protection committees. Key hygiene messages will include safe water chain through household water treatment and safe storage, hand washing with soap, proper use of latrines, drainage of stagnant water and management of solid waste including safe disposal of animal carcasses in consultation with health partners. The early recovery phase of the project will involve repair and rehabilitation of the existing WASH facilities in the target locations which includes boreholes/hand pumps, sanitation and solid waste management facilities. All activities will be carried out after a Gender and Protection risk mitigation analysis/audit has been conducted in consultation with women and girls to ensure that that safe locations are selected for intervention sites and appropriate, gender sensitive facilities are designed and implemented.
EFSL targets1500 beneficiaries (900 Females amp 600 Males)  in Rumbek Center the project will train targeted beneficiaries on good agronomic practice,training on modern fishing methods including better ways of fish preservation,transportation of fishing and vegetable kit from Juba to Rumbek and distribution of fishing and vegetable kits,formation of production groups and social audits.

The project will be implemented by Oxfam directly but in close coordination with key Clusters, including WASH, FSL and Protection, other partners on ground and the local authorities so as to ensure complementarity and avoid duplicati</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of timely lifesaving WASH services with consideration of WASH related GBV risk mitigation to the floods affected populations in Detwok and Aburoc payams, Upper Nile State, South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan is continuing to reel from the cumulative effects of years of prolonged conflict, chronic vulnerabilities and weak essential services compounded by recurrent flooding destructions. Due to this status, populations with high vulnerabilities are even more affected by flooding consequences, as it is highlighted in the September 2020 OCHA Humanitarian Snapshot. Due to heavy seasonal rains in 2020 (described as the worst in 60 years), Aburoc and the surroundings villages are facing exceptional floods (last one being in 2017), leading Relief and Rehabilitation Committee (RRF) to ask humanitarian response to answer this exceptional situation. The villages around Aburoc were in a vulnerable situation even before the floods with a limited access to basic services, provided mostly from Aburoc. 

To address the WASH basic needs of the flood-affected populations of Aburoc Internally Displaced People (IDP) site, with high concentration of the population, the surrounding villages and Detwok area, SI will implement a response in two complementary phases, as per the WASH Cluster Sectoral Standards and the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2020 objectives.

As a first line of response, access to safe water and hygiene awareness will be ensured for the populations within short period to prevent the increase of waterborne diseases brought by the floods. Four main activities will be implemented by SI teams at this stage: distributing WASH kits composed of items to ensure drinkable water at HH level, running 6 Surface Water Treatment Systems (SWATs) in the Aburoc site, establish 6 water purification points to ensure access to safe water in the villages surrounding Aburoc, support hygiene best practices as well as COVID-19 barriers dissemination thanks to the mobilization of Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs), and building and rehabilitating emergency latrines for the Aburoc site.

As a second line of response, just after the floods water recedes, SI teams will provide flood-affected households with Hygiene kits, as well as Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) kits for women and girls of menstrual age. This will complement the hygiene campaigns conducted by trained Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs). 
Throughout the whole project, SI will ensure high quality of activities, constantly adapting them according to technical standards, gender-based violence (GBV) and protection considerations and paying a strict attention to coordination and complementarity within the SI projects and with the other sectorial actors in Fashoda County to address the households&#x2019; needs in synergy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Sustainable WASH response services by enhancing access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene for 32,000 flood and disease prone-affected individuals through a single approach in Cueibet and Wulu Counties of Lakes State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This single cluster approach project will address concerns of 32,000 flood-affected, hard-to-reach, and disease-prone affected populations by providing WASH services to vulnerable populations in Cueibet and Wulu Counties (Lakes State). This will improve water supply, sanitation, and hygiene behavior and mitigate WASH-related GBV for the vulnerable IDPs and host families. This project will ensure WASH and GBV interventions are incorporated to increase the cost-effectiveness of the response by networking and closely working with existing partners within the target locations. Care for Children amp Old Age in South Sudan will engage with Gender-Based Violence partners in Cueibet and Wulu and will request the collaboration of Gender-Based Violence personnel to co-chair the Gender-Based Violence risk analysis planned within the activities.

Prior to project implementation, Care for Children amp Old Age in South Sudan will conduct, focus group discussions with women, men, boys, and girls at targeted community settlements to get feedback on the design, implementation, and monitoring of sanitation facilities, ensuring safety and mitigation of Gender-Based Violence risks, especially for females. These focus group discussions will also be utilized to trigger community action towards ending open defecation and other poor hygiene practices such as not washing hands. 

The project proposes to provide 9500 persons &#x2013; 6650 female &#x2013; 70%) with adequate clean and safe water in Cueibet and Wulu East through rehabilitation of 19 boreholes as follows:- Wulu &#x2013; (Hai Jebel, Marial Keng, Hai Jebel Two, Doketu , Makor, Bar &#x2013;Bol , Gul mar and MatonyI), while in Cueibet &#x2013; (Panakol, Abar-kouc, Langdit, Bargel, Alel, and Akecok ). Safety audits and Gender-Based Violence risk analysis before the selection of any WASH facility to be rehabilitated to enable girls and women safely access the facilities. This will be done jointly with the Gender-Based Violence actors in these localities.  

900 people (500 women amp girls) will be provided sanitation and hygiene facilities that are safe and gender-appropriate through rehabilitation of 10 toilets in settlements. The rehabilitation of this sanitation infrastructure will be based on Gender-Based Violence risk mitigation analysis/ safety audits conducted jointly with the Gender-Based Violence partners in these settlements. 

18 Hygiene promoters (12 female) will be trained and engaged, planned to reach 32,000 people (22,000 female) 1 Hygiene Promoter is planned to reach 15 households per week. 

MHM kits will be distributed to the 1,500 (900 girls and 600 women) who are most vulnerable identified using the following criteria: low-income girls in schools of adolescent age and women, unaccompanied or orphaned girls, and persons with disabilities. Women and girls will also be provided with information on how and to whom they can share feedback or criticism about the kit contents and distribution practices by female staff. One dignity kit will be for two-three women in a household. A needs assessment will be conducted at the beginning of the project implementation phase.

CCOSS will also assess the target population and identify at least 1500 most vulnerable households in Cueibet and Wulu  (total 9,000 individuals) for distribution of WASH NFIs &#x2013; which will include:- filter cloth Pur sachets Aquatabs collapsible jerry can/bucket, and soap. 

All interventions will follow Covid-19 protocols including those guidelines laid down in the WASH cluster Covid-19 Preparedness and Response Strategy document.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing Food Security and Livelihoods of Vulnerable Agropastoralists Communities in Aweil South County, Northern Bahr el Ghazal State, South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An estimated 5.82 million people are currently (December 2020-March 2021) projected to face IPC Phase 3/worse levels of food insecurity. This is projected to rise to 7.24 million people with at least 7,000 people projected to face IPC phase 5 between April-July 2021 in Aweil South County, Northern Bahr el Ghazal State (South Sudan IPC Report, December 2020). The recent Food Security Outlook (September 2020) Update has projected highest levels of food insecurity in 2021 ever recorded since 2014. This coupled with a persistently low food/ income sources in more than half of the population, urgent and sustained humanitarian aid through food assistance will be critical to preventing more extreme food security outcomes in 2021 including projected IPC Phase 5 across all the Payams of Aweil South County (South Sudan IPC, 2020). The lean season is likely to see a deterioration in food insecurity particularly in market dependent counties such as Aweil South as majority of households (HHs) deplete their food stocks and are unable to purchase sufficient food at extremely high prices (National Market Profile for South Sudan, December, 2020 FEWSNET Food Security Outlook, 2020-21).
Many vulnerable host and displaced families, especially women, widowed women, child headed HHs, the elderly, boys and girls including people with special needs solely depend on fishing among other coping strategies like vegetable farming along rivers and flood plains in Aweil South. Fishing resources and vegetable production are projected to deliver immediate/short term benefits and still play a very key role in saving lives and securing HH food and nutrition security in 2021 especially among children (boys and girls) under 5 years and pregnant women who are at risk of malnutrition.
VSF Suisse proposes an emergency response in line with the Reserve Allocation that will be critical in addressing urgent/critical projected food insecurity including projected IPC Phase 5 pockets in Aweil South County. Proposed initiatives will target Aweil South, which has been classified among Priority 1 Counties. The proposed action will prioritize the immediate and short term lifesaving activities via pre-positioning of emergency fishing and vegetable livelihood kits from FAO Core pipeline including inter-cluster synergies through setting up vegetable demonstration plots/ kitchen backyard garden demonstration sites at nutrition facilities, whose criteria will include areas with access to dry season vegetable production at nearby rivers/ hafir&#x2019;s/ hand dug wells/ water points and training of nutrition volunteers and trainings in improved agronomic and fishing practices, including reducing post-harvest losses and cooking techniques. Key livelihood inputs will be prepositioning from FAO Core pipeline targeting populations in IPC 4, projected IPC Phase 5 who are also at risk of malnutrition in Aweil South. 
Targeted direct beneficiaries are made up of 13,867 households (83,202 people) comprised of 25000, 25000 boys, 16601 men and 16601 women &#x2013; includes youth (male and female), elderly, people with special needs across all the Payams (Ayai, Gakrol, Nyieth, Nyocawany I, Nyocawany II, Panthou, Tarweng, Tieraliet, Wathmuok) of Aweil South County. 
VSF Suisse 24 years of experience/ presence and proven capacity will deliver high quality programming by leveraging on strong grass root networks, local knowledge, understanding of seasonal and location specific contexts. Other ongoing VSF Suisse programming in the area will further complement the action including inter-cluster synergies and collaborations that will ensure a multi-sectoral approach, quality programming, cost efficiency in addition to mainstreaming cross-cutting programmatic approaches that include application of AAP principles, protection including GBV mitigation measures, Do No Harm, context analysis, gender equity, HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, environmental sustainability including COVID 19 risks spread mitigation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Livelihood Scale Up Response for the most vulnerable food-insecure populations of Pibor, Akobo, Aweil South, Tonj North, Tonj South, Tonj East Counties of South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Republic of South Sudan &#x2013; the world&#x2019;s youngest nation &#x2013; has been plagued by multiple hazards including conflict, catastrophic flooding for the second year in the row, inter-communal violence, displacement, economic crisis, pest and diseases, invasion of desert locust, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest IPC Real Time Quality Review suggest that five priority areas face Catastrophic levels of food insecurity (Akobo, Aweil South, Tonj East, South, North), while according to the IPC Famine Review Committee (FRC), some payams of Pibor  are &#x2018;Famine likely&#x2019;. In the projection periods that run from December 2020 to July 2021, the same counties maintain their IPC Phase 5 (Famine Likely) classification, while Kizongora and Maruwa Payams are classified as IPC Phase 5 (Risk of Famine). In response, FAO has launched its 2021 ELRP Scale up Plan to save lives, enhance household livelihood, own food production and reduce their annual food gap, decrease the degree and frequency with which households depend on external food assistance, and strengthen their capacity to absorb shocks. Given the gravity of the food security situation in the months to come, FAO will work with all FSL partners on the ground to expand the scope and increase the impact of its lean season, main season and livestock vaccination and treatment campaigns in the most vulnerable areas of the country (including the aforementioned counties of highest food security concern). Through the third allocation of SSCHF funding, FAO and partners will more specifically aim to protect the livelihoods of the vulnerable households and increase their food production and safeguard livestock assets of the most vulnerable agropastoral and pastoral households. As the FSL pipeline manager for livelihood assistance, this will be achieved by dispatching a total of 50,000 emergency livelihood kits (30,000 sets of fishing kits, 6,600 Kg of vegetable seeds and 520 MT of crop seeds) for 50,000 HH (300,000 beneficiaries)  to frontline FSL partners on the ground, in addition to 128,000 vials of vaccines (8 Categories of different types of vaccines to vaccinate 2.5 million livestock) in support of livestock vaccination and treatment campaigns in the most at-risk areas. Through these means, FAO and partners aim to support sustained and adequate humanitarian assistance in South Sudan from the lean to main agricultural seasons of 2021. The beneficiaries will be the most vulnerable people in Kiziongora, Maruwo, Pibor, Lekuongole, Verteth, Boma, Gumuruk  in Pibor (60,000 individuals) Bilkey, Dengiok, Nyandit, Buong, Barmach, Diror, Walgak  in Akobo (60,000 individuals) Nyocawany, Ayai, Gakorl/Gakrol, Nyieth, Panthou, Tar-weng, Tiar-aleit, Wathmuok  in Aweil South (36,000 individuals) Makuac, Paliang, Paweng  in Tonj East (60,000 individuals), Warrap (Awul) , Rualbet, Kirrik  in Tonj North (48,000 individuals) and Thiet, Manyang-Ngok, Jak  in Tonj South county (36,000 individuals) of South Sudan, those falling in category 3, 4 and 5 of the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC). Beneficiaries include Internally Displaced Population (IDP), host communities, refugees, and community vulnerable groups&#x2019; representatives (female headed household, households with malnourished children, single mothers widows, elders, handicapped or chronically ill,, refugee, youth at risk, survivors of GBV.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Integrated Emergency Lifesaving Health Services for people in acute humanitarian needs in Gumuruk and Lekuangole Payams of Pibor County in Jonglei State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNH is a dual mandated organization that provides development and emergency response. Based on our experience in emergency response, developed this project targeting Gumuruk and Lekuangole following consultative meetings with the State Ministry of Health, County Health Department, local authority, affected persons including elderly amp persons with disability.
The main trigger for development of this proposal is the December 2020 IPC result which indicated that about 20% of the population in Pibor is in IPC 5 which is Catastrophe. For the past two consecutive years, Gumuruk and Lekunagole experienced intense flooding and cyclical waves of intercommunal violence. 
IRNA assessment conducted in September 2020 shows that about 25,959 and 29,167 people of Lekuangole and Gumuruk respectively were affected following the intercommunal violence and flooding. 
Gumuruk and Lekaungole has only 1 mobile unit each, not able to meet the health needs of the people who are in acute humanitarian needs. No CEmONC services, limited BEmONC services, no inpatient facility, most of the affected populations have no access to lifesaving health care. Measles transmission continued despite the reactive campaign.
UNH proposed to intervene through provision of emergency and basic lifesaving health services for people who are in acute humanitarian needs with aim to mitigate the risk of food insecurity and negative consequences of COVID-19. Will do this through deployment of 4 mobile units (2 each in Gumuruk and Lekuangole) and strengthening 2 PHCCs (1 in each Payam) through staffing and provision of medical supplies and equipment. The mobile units and the PHCCs will provide packages ranging from screening, essential health care, treatment, referral, promotive and preventive services/risk communication and surveillance/EWARN. The activities implemented under these packages included but not limited to: 
	Conduct rapid test for malaria with RDT, diagnose and provide treatment for uncomplicated malaria, respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea cases.
	Provide Basic Obstetric and Neonatal Care (BeMONC) services at the facilities to ensure institution deliveries and support community deliveries.
	Conduct community mobilization to create demand for EPI and provide routine immunization.
	Identify and manage SAM children with medical complications.
	Provide curative OPD consultation. 
	Conduct 3 days training for 20 health workers from Gumuruk and Lekuangole PHCCs on BEmONC. 
	Conduct training for 56 health workers on disease surveillance and outbreak response including COVID-19 infection prevention and control and IMCI/EWARS/common illnesses, case management guidelines and protocol.
	Provision of GBV and MHPS services.
	Ensure liaison and coordination with national, county health authorities.
	Surveillance, Early warning and Response for Disease Outbreak detection and management
	Sample collection and testing for diseases that are of epidemic potential
The proposed activities are in line with the reserved strategy and health cluster strategies. To implement these activities, UNH needs 400,000.00 USD to implement the project for 6 months, February 24 to August 23, 2021. With these resources, UNH will reach 50,811 beneficiaries 40,650 returnees (Men 9,948, women 11,191 boys 9,349 and girls 10,162) IDPs 2,540 (men 604 women 717, boys 584 and girls 635) host communities 7,621 (men 1,802, women 2,161, boys 1,753 and girls 1,905). People with disability will be reached through mobile clinics and about 138 targeted (Men 40, women 35, boys 33, girls 30).
UNH will work with other health partners, WASH, FSL and Protection partners to ensure synergies and value for money, will engage the CHD and development health partner LiveWell to take over at the end of the project to ensure sustainability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated emergency health services to vulnerable and affected populations in Tonj South and Tonj East Counties Warrap State, South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health service delivery in South Sudan has had challenges precipitated by years of civil unrest, political instability and natural Disasters. This has led to weakened health systems thus affecting health service delivery in the country and has remained having one of the worst health indicators in the world. Maternal mortality rate remains at 789/100000 live births which is far above the threshold.(UNICEF 2020).
Tonj South and East have had serious health challenges due to internal conflict among the communities which has seen displacements of communities and weakened the health systems. According to IRNA report on multispectral Needs assessment done on 12th -17th May 2020, a total of 91695 individuals were displaced due to internal conflict. This was the time preparation for planting was due thus affected the livelihoods of the populations.
Flooding has also been a major problem in the county and it affected livelihoods, Destroyed crops and also submerged health facilities leading to major Humanitarian Crisis. According to the IPC analysis done in December 2020, a total of 17991 individuals in Tonj East and a total of 13849 individuals in Tonj South are in IPC phase five. This is a very catastrophic condition which calls for holistic approach to avert loss of lives.
TADO therefore will support the health service delivery to affected populations in Tonj South and East by Providing integrated health services  through mobile health interventions and static facilities in the two counties. TADO will run 2 Mobile units one in each county and 2 PHCUs one in each county to improve access to health services to the affected populations. The Services will be offered in Paliang Payam and Wunlit Payams in Tonj East and Tonj and Wanhalel Payams in Tonj South. 
This will ensure that the affected populations have access to live saving health services like, Out patient consultations in the mobile units and in the static facilities, EPI services which will ensure that the children are vaccinated thus averting vaccine preventable infections like measles, ANC and deliveries by skilled births attendants which will greatly reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates.
TADO will offer Integrated Nutrition services through growth monitoring, Case management of SAM with Medical Complications and referral to Nutrition centers children diagnosed with malnutrition through routine growth monitoring services in the health facilities. This will be done through collaboration with World Vision which is a Lead Nutrition partner on ground.
TADO will also ensure behavior change communication through health education which will ensure that the communities will embrace early health seeking behaviors, practice hygienic behavior and also improved nutritional status through good eating habits. COVID 19 prevention messaging will also be passed to the communities and prevention guidelines will be observed during the implementation of the project to ensure that the health facility staffs and the communities have knowledge on prevention measures.
TADO will ensure that affected and vulnerable populations are given mental health services through provision of Psychosocial support and physiological first aid during the project implementation. Referral pathways for GBV victims and case management will be done thus ensuring that Protection issues in the community are taken care of. 
TADO will target 48290 vulnerable and affected populations with 11325 Male, 16120 Female, 8915 Boys and 11930 Girls, This will be 14487 Host Communities, 24145 IDPs and 9658 returnees Out of which 28974 will be from Tonj East and 19316 From Tonj South and 6300 people with disabilities.
There will be proper monitoring mechanisms with weekly, monthly and quarterly reports shared with the cluster and ministry of health. Financial reports will also be timely summited together with Mid Project repor</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving integrated primary health services; prevent detect and respond to disease outbreaks among the vulnerable populations in Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA).</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to contribute to the reduction of excess morbidity and mortality resulting from common infectious diseases, vector-borne diseases and epidemic-prone diseases as a consequence of severe food insecurity being driven by multiple shocks (effects of Covid-19, economic crisis and high food prices, impact of flooding on livelihood, and sub-national violence) among 28,000  (10,839 Men,  11281 Women, 2999  Girls and 2881 Boys) in Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA) of South Sudan particular  Western part payams (Pibor and Verteth payams) . This aim will be obtained  through the provision of time-critical, life-saving frontline quality health services, capacity building of health care workers, and strengthening of disease surveillance systems in the GPAA. The WHO Mobile Medical Teams (eMMT) provides integrated health services in deep field locations through mobile medical outreach modality. The eMMT comprise of experts from different fields of medicine often deployed strategically to provide gap-filling services in areas with serious unmet health needs. Such areas may include locations without static health facilities or those with no active health partners, locations with access constraints and those receiving high numbers of returnees, IDPs or refugees. The mobile clinics will offer outpatient consultations for common conditions, minor procedures, screening and treatment for malnutrition, immunization services, and referral services. Besides, WHO will train community health care workers to ensure continuity of health service provision in GPAA. 
Rapid assessments has been conducted in the GPAA to identify unmet needs and allow for ongoing health service provision, meanwhile, the Rapid Response Teams (RRT) will be deployed alongside the eMMTs to conduct case verification and investigation of suspected disease outbreaks. In addition, WHO will enhance capacity for disease surveillance and reporting to enhance detection of epidemic-prone diseases and continue to provide timely technical support for appropriate response by the Ministry of Health and other health partners 
The routine surveillance system will be enhanced through the deployment of mobile phone-based EWARS reporting by the static and mobile clinics attending to the needs of the community. This will enhance weekly reporting by facilities to ensure early detection of and response to disease outbreaks.

WHO will also conduct a risk assessment for common diseases such as measles and cholera in GPAA to ascertain the need for preventive vaccination campaigns and guide the planning process for preventive vaccination campaigns as well as secure adequate vaccines as guided by the risk assessment findings.
Through its network of experts, both within and outside the country WHO will conduct targeted and focused capacity building of health workers working in the health facilities. The proposed capacity building will cover how to run mobile outreach programs, disease surveillance and outbreak response, case management, and infection prevention and control (IPC) within health facilities, and Clinical Management of Rape.

This project will also aim to procure and distribute emergency health kits to support health partners responding in the six prioritised Counties: Pibor, Akobo, Tonj East, Tonj  North, Tonj South, and Aweil South. The distributed emergency health kits will benefit 377, 236 (Women151987, men 146029, girls 40402, and boys 38818).

This project is a scale up of  the ongoing WHO emergency health in GPAA.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of multi-sectoral life-saving services to crisis affected populations in Tonj East, Tonj South and Tonj North counties</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis released in December 2020, a projected 5.82 million people will face food crisis in the country between December 2020 and March 2021. The number of affected populations estimated to increase to 7.24 million from April to July 2021 in the lean season. Based on the projections, Twenty two (22) counties classified in emergency acute food insecurity with the number likely to increase to 33 counties in the period April to July 2021. An unprecedented caseload of 38,916 SAM, and 116,029 MAM burden in under-fives projected for 2021 in Warrap state.  Greater Tonj is among the most affected by food insecurity in the country. An estimate of 136,814 people projected to be food insecure by March 2021, with a further deterioration of 20% expected by July 2021. Between March and July 2021, the number of people at catastrophe level (IPC5) will halve in Tonj South, remain the same in Tonj North but double in Tonj East. Overall, the proportion of people at famine-likely level (IPC4) will increase by 27% across the zone during the same period. A deteriorating economy characterized by currency devaluation and the COVID-19 pandemic have added to the complexity by exhausting people&#x2019;s adaptive capacity in the face of recurrent intercommunal violence and flooding. According to the Integrated Nutrition and Mortality SMART Survey conducted in Tonj North in July 2019, 38.4% of children had illnesses while 65.3% did not boil or treat their drinking water
This is a multi-sectoral life-saving response to crisis affected populations in Tonj North, Tonj East, and Tonj South counties, Warrap state. The response will provide protection (child protection, Gender Based Violence, and peace building), health, nutrition, and Food Security and Livelihoods services to crisis affected households in the greater Tonj area for a period up to 9 months, save for FSL intervention which will be four months going by the seasonal calendar. World Vision partners with Comitato Collaborazione Medica (CCM) in nutrition sector in all the three counties of the greater Tonj meanwhile, World Vision directly implements Health in Tonj North. WVSS also directly implements FSL and Protection components directly in all the three counties of Tonj. Overall, the project aims to reach 117,244 people (22,474 men, 41,797 women, 21,949 boys, and 30,842 girls) of which 55,000 individuals will be supported under the protection, over 49,200 households under FSL, 13,217 persons under Nutrition and 20,840 under Health. Additionally 14,647(9138 U5 and 5509 PLW) 1570(748M, 822F) SAM Children U5, 4173(1989M, 2184F) MAM Children U5, 3395 (1618M, 1777F) BSFP U5, 1430 BSFP PLW and 4079 AM PLWs direct beneficiaries under Nutrition . With regards to complementarity and integrated approach, children at all contact points in the health facility will be screened for acute malnutrition and referred for nutrition services as appropriate
The main protection risks in the greater Tonj include psychological distress due to conflict, child marriage/forced marriage, intimate partner violence, child neglect, intensified intercommunal conflict among others. The project therefore will under the following interventions to address the protection concerns: comprehensive case management, psychosocial support, establish referral pathways, child protection and Gender-Based Violence (GBV) awareness campaigns, provide mobile psychosocial support services, run child right clubs, construct and operate Women and Girls Friendly Spaces (WGFSs), support people with special needs, and conflict mitigation through peacebuilding activities. Linkage and referral will be done between health and nutrition sector for RDT testing, vaccination and management of medical complications. TSFP discharges will be linked to FSL sector and GFD for participation in own production and income generating activities for resilience</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobile Protection Response for the most affected population in Aweil South and Greater Tonj</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project Nonviolent Peaceforce (NP) will deploy a mobile protection team to respond emergency protection concerns resulting from widespread food insecurity exacerbated by flooding that has affected more than 1 million people across South Sudan, since July 2020 (SSHF Allocation Strategy Paper- 3rd reserve allocation, January 2021). Most protection needs arising from these kinds of situations are as follows: displacement, increase of Gender-Based-Violence (GBV) cases, primarily against women and children, unaccompanied children, child-abduction, forced recruitment and inter-communal violence. NP is aiming for an integrated approach and contributing to a better collaboration in emergency response. Consequently, NP will conduct missions to analyze the specifics of the linkage between food insecurity and protection in these locations to inform response and prevention interventions. Furthermore, NP will respond to identified protection needs for specific location in collaboration with Food Security and Livelihood (FSL) partners. 

NP plans to conduct at least four assessment and response missions over the period of five months in Aweil South and Greater Tonj (Tonj East, Tonj North and Tonj South) with a duration about 14 days per mission. Missions will be conducted to hard-to reach areas, or where no strong or static protection presence exists, to respond to these protection needs. Each mission will be determined in accordance with the Protection Cluster (PC) analysis, including consultation with roving colleagues and partners in these locations, state level PC, as well as with the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG), Inter-Cluster Working Group (ICWG), and OCHA.
 
To support this process, NP will operationalize the following planning processes:
1) Preparations, in consultation with OCHA and the Protection Cluster (PC), and state level PC(if possible) confirming response locations, contacting local partners and arranging logistical and security aspects.

2) Following NP&#x2019;s deployment to the area, NP will undertake response activities (which are expected to take around fourteen days per response, considering possible changes due to needs and security situation to address the most pressing needs identified to increase the safety and security of at-risk civilians. These activities will include strategic patrolling, protective presence, referral, community capacity building/awareness raising on GBV and Child protection (CP) as well as on community-based protection mechanism, provision of child safe spaces (CSS), as well as protection mainstreaming to partner organizations and technical protection support during registration and distributions. Such activities seek to enhance the protection needs of those affected by food insecurity in regions where no static protection partners are present, supporting the cluster&#x2019;s response through a mobile protection team

3) NP will then provide a de-briefing in Juba to share analysis, produce and disseminate assessment and response reports to the PC and relevant stakeholders. Should there be urgent need, the team may share early findings with the PC and OCHA from the field or immediately upon return to Juba to support and inform inter-sector, frontline response. A full protection mission analysis report, with emphasis on emerging risks and mitigation measures, will then be submitted to the PC and OCHA within one week. Extensive follow up on recommendations will be made through subsequent PC meetings, as indicated in the description of activity 1.1.1.

In light of the current situation of the outbreak of COVID-19, NP will always act based on the recommendations from the HLTF on COVID-19 pandemic in order to comply and to safeguard the security for the staff but also for the community members.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated multi-sectors Protection, CCCM and SNFI response and assistance in Malakal and Renk to support vulnerable people displaced.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DRC proposes to collaborate with NNGO Humanitarian Development Consortium (HDC) to implement a multi-sector and integrated Shelter and Non-Food Items (S/NFI), Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) and Protection programme in Malakal County in Upper Nile State. The overall aim of the project is to ensure that the target communities have safe and dignified access to urgent S/NFI, CCCM and Protection services. The program will directly target an estimated 15,000 affected persons (without double counting) in Malakal Country, through integrated SNFI (15,000), CCCM (7,000)  and protection services and support (10,570). Humanitarian assistance will be provided through a static and roving response by DRC and HDC existing teams in Malakal. 

In Malakal, DRC and HDC will seek to address SNFI needs of vulnerable conflict and disaster affected communities through both in-kind S/NFI assistance, cash based shelter repairs and maintenance, as well as strengthening of state level coordination through SNFI State Focal Point in Upper Nile. Under the technical guidance of DRC, HDC will implement general protection, including identification of PSN, referrals to service providers, information dissemination on key protection needs, advocacy for gaps and life skills training, as well as some HLP activities. These will be complemented and informed by ongoing protection monitoring done in Upper Nile by DRC. DRC &#x2013; though a roving CCCM approach - will also coordinate and monitor multi-sector services, forming and strengthening community-based governance structures for enhanced community participation, self-governance and self-reliance, which will be able to support HDC to further minimize protection risks. 

In Malakal a conflict sensitive approach will be taken to implement shelter assistance, primarily through a focus on housing, land and property rights and issues in the county. HDC has contextual and vast experience in HLP, ensuring a sensitive approach throughout the whole project implementation. Similarly, DRC will provide technical guidance and mentorship to HDC, as well as ensure protection mainstreaming and adherence to age, gender and diversity principles. Additionally, DRC and HDC will ensure any risks to COVID-19 are mitigated and minimized by adapting programming in line with cluster priority recommendations, both for affected persons and staff.  DRC and HDC will follow COVID-19 cluster guidelines observing social distancing, no-contact policy, access to hand washing and minimize number of persons gathering during any activity. COVID-19 related messages will be incorporated to all relevant activities such as meetings-including virtual meetings, FCRM desk, information desk, distribution points etc. To learn while adapting programmes to COVID-19, DRC initiated &quot;learning as we adapt&quot; initiative to document changes, results, lessons learnt and best practices. The project will be implemented over a period of 12 months, supported by existing programming and funding.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coordinated support to the NGO Forum members to improve and save lives</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to contribute to effective and principled delivery of humanitarian assistance in South Sudan by national and international member organizations of the South Sudan NGO Forum in order to save lives and improve lives within the context of Revitalized Peace Agreement signed on September 12, 2018. Specifically, the project will work on various aspects of the creation of an &#x2018;enabling environment&#x2019; for humanitarian assistance, namely: administrative, legal, political and security-related concerns, but also gaps in coordination and support to frontline engagement with authorities.

As a network and membership body of over 379 NGOs (263 NNGOs and 116 INGOs), the South Sudan NGO Forum provides a unique platform to promote safe and secure access providing capacity building for NGOs through providing humanitarian training sharing best practices in humanitarian delivery and information exchanges forging collaborations between the INGOs and national NGOs coordinating the collective voices of the NGOs for common positions ensuring accountability to effected populations the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and joint engagement for enabling environment for INGOs and NNGOs operating in South Sudan. The members of NGO Forum are present in all counties of South Sudan and deliver services across all sectors.

This project will allow the NGO Forum to continue to effectively support the NGO community in South Sudan by facilitating the protection of humanitarian space and respect for aid workers for improved delivery of humanitarian assistance to save and improved lives. The NGO Forum will strengthen and enhance coordination on issues of security, bureaucratic and access impediments and facilitate joint engagement with authorities, both national and local levels in tackling impediments that interfere with the effective delivery of services to the populations in need. The project will also focus on identifying and supporting referral pathways for the reporting of cases of sexual exploitation and abuse, and increasing the understanding across the sector of how to prevent or respond to cases.

The project will also support the review of the NGO Act 2016 to ensure humanitarian space and NGO space are protected for continued delivery of assistance to populations I need. In a similar vein the project will further support the development of information systems for NGO staffing with the national Ministry of Labour to help protect NGOs national staff whose positions are regularly politicized at field levels. This will provide national level assurance and protection of legally recruited NGO national staff.  

The NGO Forum has a 3-person security team at the national-level. To enhance the effectiveness of this team, in the interests of members, this project will help to project safety and security support and best practices to the states by providing safety, security and PSEA focal points who are focused on ensuring members are safe, able to operate effectively and within the guidelines of best practice, such as on PSEA.
The project will build on the improved relations with national level government authorities to improve relations with local authorities to reduce bureaucratic impediments and to improve acknowledgement of NGOs&#x2019; humanitarian identity and adherence to humanitarian principles and contribute to safe operating environments and allow access to populations in need of assistance. The project will facilitate workshops at national level with state agencies such as the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) to identify key issues affecting humanitarian agency operations. The state level workshops will be held with local authorities to discuss these issues affecting humanitarian programmes and solutions and action plans will be identified. COVID-19 awareness outreach information dissemination will be part and parcel of every engagements under project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Integrated Education and Protection Services in Malakal County of Upper Nile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After the displacement of persons in Malakal, the inter cluster assessment revealed that more than 70% of internally displaced persons (IDPs) were children (girls and boys) and women. At least four schools in the pre-crisis period are no longer operational, making it impossible for children in Wau Shilluk to access education services. The project targets 5 functional schools t in Malakal-, PoC and Wau Shilluk which have limited number of safe classrooms and sitting facilities to promote learning. The target schools have limited teachers and inadequate teaching and learning materials to enhance quality of learning in schools. A number of women interviewed requested for adult learning intervention program in order to gain literacy and numeracy skills to support their school-going children. With the return of relative peace in Malakal and its surrounding payams such as Wau Shilluk, there is an expected rise in the number of children enrolling to the few schools available. The returnees and affected populations that remained in Malakal will mount pressure to the limited classrooms and teaching and learning materials. Serious gaps also exist in immediate gender based violence (GBV) life-saving services (clinical management of rape, psychosocial counselling) for survivors and populations at risk of GBV. There is no WGFS for women and girls for group and individual PSS. According to FGD participants, survivors of domestic violence do not know where to go to report and receive services.

Given the low access and inadequate actors and services working across Education, Child Protection and GBV in Malakal and its immediate surrounding Payams, WVSS proposes this project to meet the identified needs of these affected returnees, IDPs and host communities in Malakal. Through the Education component, WVSS will improve access to quality education for 5000 (3000 boys and 2000 boys) in the 5 targeted schools by rehabilitation of 10 classrooms, construction of 2 semi-permanent learning spaces, building the capacity of various stake holders (100 teachers and motivating them with incentives, 55 PTA members, and 25 State/County/Payam officials), providing school supplies to all learners and teachers. The project will address literacy gaps using the &#x2018;unlock literacy model&#x2019; that will boost literacy outcomes of learners in lower grades (1-3) by engaging teachers and learners of lower grades in reading sessions. In strengthening the education system/policies, there will be joint and termly monitoring visits comprising of 10 participants from the state, county, Payams and WVSS. 

Through the protection component, the project will establish and equip 3 child friendly spaces (CFS) with furniture, mats and other materials, benefiting 600 children. Other interventions will include training of 16 CFS animators/ECD caregivers, training and supporting 5 school clubs, conduct community dialogues on child rights involving 30 participants, and training of 16 various stakeholders on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA). In response to the COVID 19 pandemic, all teachers will be sensitized and trained on the basics of COVID 19 interventions. All teachers will be engaged as social mobilizers during the school closure period to reach the children and rest of community with COVID-19 messages. The campaign will be monitored closely and indicators such as number of teachers and percentage of enrolment reached will be reported. On COVID-19 preparedness, the project will procure for the target schools hygiene kits (soap, buckets, sanitizers), and non-contact human infrared thermometers which will be used when schools reopen.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Life-saving and integrated Education, Child Protection and Gender Based Violence Services to Conflict-affected Children  Youth in Ayod County, Jonglei State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS and Christian Mission for Development (CMD) are proposing this 9-month integrated Education in Emergency (EiE) and Protection (CP and GBV) intervention, in order to address critical gaps in service provision in Ayod County. The project will target the needs of the affected population and based on the experience and presence of both partners in the area. INTERSOS and CMD will work closely with the existing structures and stakeholders, abiding to South Sudan guidelines and protocols, and empowering the community and local capacities. Focusing on needs of children, the partners will target Wau and Pajiek Payams. 
The core of the CP activities will be conducted in 2 community-based Child Friendly Spaces (CFS),whilst EiE ones in 12 CMD supported primary schools and 2 ECD centres where 7,367 children aged 3 to 17 (2,843 girls) will attend EiE and Psychosocial Support (PSS) activities. 
INTERSOS and CMD will implement an education model in Ayod, aimed at sustaining continued learning, while adhering to COVID 19 infection control and prevention protocols. This will include a neighborhood schooling model through which teachers staying within the vicinity of neighborhood homes will reach out to a cluster of children. Volunteer teachers will also be involved in IEC materials distribution as well as COVID19 awareness.
One of the focus of the project will lie in stabilizing regular attendance of children in 2 Early Child Development (ECD) and 12 primary schools in the target area. This goal will be accomplished by providing inclusive and protective education services, refurbishing of Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS), as scale up of the existing facilities, and WASH facilities, teaching and learning supplies and trainings in order to increase teacher&#x2019;s pedagogic skill and PSS care. Moreover, the project will target Parents and Teachers Associations (PTA) and School Management Committees (SMC) as well as local education officials providing them with trainings on addressing CP/GBV issues in schools and enhancing local education leadership.
The project will also focus on establishing and strengthening the community-based protection networks (CBPN) and youth clubs to prevent and respond to child protection risks, while conducting workshops on children&apos;s wellbeing, needs in different development stages, risks and threats in the community, positive parenting skills through active listening, conflict resolution and prevention of family separation. 
Awareness events for in and out of school children in the CFS door to door sessions, and campaigns and public drama sessions on back to school, girl-child education, child protection issues including Other Vulnerable Children (OVC). Workshop with non-CP actors on child protection and referral pathways to ensure a well-coordinated CP and GBV response that is both age- and sex-sensitive. 
All the activities will follow SOPs and regulations developed in the framework of the Covid-19 response, adapting the methodology of implementation. Moreover, awareness sessions will also focus on the disease spreading, on its prevention and mitigation measures, as well as on the possible impact on people with special needs, including children and women. 
The overall target of the project will be INTERSOS and CMD work closely with line departments and local authorities in the project area. The long-term presence of the organizations, their cooperation and collaboration with local key stakeholders and involvement of community members in their programming led to trust and positive working relationships. INTERSOS and CMD Country Office representatives as well as field-based Project manager and Field Coordinators hold regularly programmatic and administrative meetings with governmental bodies represented by the concerned ministries. 
INTERSOS will target 15,367 (6,843 F) vulnerable children, including 400 children with disabilities, belonging to IDP, returnee and host communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve access to inclusive and protective education services for vulnerable children and youth, with GBV component, in Bor South county, Jonglei State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to meet the immediate, medium and long-term educational needs of the target communities in Bor South county, Jonglei State. Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH) and Christian Mission Development (CMD) will target 7 schools in Bor South with 6180 students, 63 teachers and 21 PTA and community members. PAH and CMD will target schools that no partner is supporting with infrastructure including TLS and WASH as well as PSS activities, and activities targeting improved learning environment through access to teaching and learning materials, training.

PAH will target schools for improving the infrastructure, including constructing and renovating TLS spaces, WASH facilities construction and rehabilitation. In addition, the protection component of PAH&#x2019;s activities will focus on PSS, PFA for children as well as awareness raising on child protection and GBV  prevention, management and mitigation. This will aim at reducing the risks of GBV, child labor, early marriage, also to reduce the level of waterborne diseases, and increase school&#x2019;s attendance. CMD will focus on providing textbooks, teaching and learning supplies, ECD kits and relevant trainings. 

Holistic package of messaging on disease prevention, sanitation and hygiene, training of teachers and communities on health related issues and psychosocial support trainings will be conducted jointly with PAH and CMD. 
Addressing TLS and WASH needs will improve enrollment and continuity of learners in school as lack of basic essential services such as learning space, water, sanitation and poor hygiene can lead to diseases outbreak that pose threat to the children. PAH and CMD will mainly do this by:
a) Rehabilitation/installation of hand washing facilities: The hand washing facilities will be established or the existing ones repaired to support hand washing at critical times in the schools.
b) Rehabilitation/Establishment of latrines: focus on sanitation in school/learning spaces with aim of cholera prevention, preparedness and response through provision of emergency latrine where no school latrines is available. Gender disaggregated sanitation facilities will be improved in 7 schools through both construction and rehabilitation of existing latrines. Health clubs will promote good hygiene among the learners to keep them safe from water borne diseases.
c) COVID -19 related activities in schools and communities such as awareness raising on symptoms, prevention, child protection risks relating to COVID 19, provision of PPEs for PAH staff and teachers, and supply of handwashing facilities and soap
d) Training of school-based community groups (Parents Teacher Associations (PTAs), School Management Committees (SMCs), teachers and adolescents/youth) on hygiene messaging on disease symptoms, modes of transmission and prevention, referral to treatment/health facility. 
e)Establishment/repair of non-functional water points nearby schools and construction of rain water harvesting systems to ensure that the schools/learning spaces have access to safe water for drinking and personal hygiene and ensure that there is water for the hand washing facilities to be used
f) Provide psychosocial support through trainings targeting specifically teachers, school&#x2019;s authorities, parent-teacher association members, local administration. Protection information sessions will be held at schools and community levels, in relation to Education, GBV, child&#x2019;s rights and protection risks on community and school level.
g) Conduct schools and community awareness sessions on Child Protection, Gender Based Violence reducing children&#x2019;s risks and ensuring their safe access to learning facilities based on Community Based Child Protection structures.
h) provide teaching and learning materials to 7 schools for improved learning environment, including ECD kits for ECD centers.
i) provide teacher training on improved teaching methodologies, including PSS and PFA training for various groups (PTAs, etc.)</narrative>
