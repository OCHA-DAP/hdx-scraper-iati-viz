  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ABAAD has been implementing NASEEJ-2 according to plan and with few disruptions for most of the project period from its inception until recent developments related to the global spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Following minimal disruption to direct services (e.g. the WGSS, MWH, and Men Center) in the light of the political instability of October and November 2019, direct services were able to resume normal operation. Furthermore, following the formation of a new government, ABAAD resumed the coordination with the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA) for the launching of the GBV National SOPs as well as the Case Management Curriculum in addition to the self-care curriculum for GBV and CP front-liners. 

In this request for adjustment, direct services are to continue; ABAAD is proposing to adapt its service delivery modality for a period of 6 months in addition to provide food transfers to the most vulnerable families in Lebanon.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will aim to target vulnerable individuals, with a special focus on women and girls, with a 50-50 split between host and refugee communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Implemented Activities Within the Period Under Review 
In order to achieve the stated objectives, we proposed a total of nine unique activities that feed into the desired outcome. The activities proposed were building a Digital Rights violations reporting platform, website upgrade, Strategic Litigation, Capacity Building, Digital Rights Workshops, Digital Rights Media Fellowship, Research, Digital Rights in Africa Report, Media and Communication, Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (2020 and 2021), and participating in global convenings (RightsCon and FOC). 

Media Fellowship 
The Fellowship program is a 5-month program designed to immerse selected journalists in digital rights and digital inclusion advocacy and intervention efforts in Africa. Selected journalists (4) worked with Paradigm Initiative on various projects and contributed to improving media coverage of relevant issues in the first year. The fellows published stories to support their learning during the fellowship, including topics such as digital platforms and protests, digital footprints in policy, language diversity online, hate speech and fundamental human rights. The fellows produced at least 12 reports published on PIN&#x2019;s website or their affiliated organisation&#x2019;s platform throughout the lifetime of the project.

Digital Rights in Africa Report 
The 2019 Digital Rights in Africa report, covering the period between January and December 2019, was released in March 2020. Building on previous reports published since 2016, the 2019 Digital Rights in Africa report provided in-depth analysis on the state of digital rights in Nigeria and 12 other African countries, and examined violations such as Internet disruptions, illegal surveillance, arrest of bloggers, and the passage of hurtful legislation, amongst others. In addition to this, we worked with a production company to convert the report into a short movie titled Training Day. By the end of the reporting period, the movie grossed over 360,000 views on YouTube and over 1.1 million views on Facebook, and was screened by four television stations including the Nigerian Television Authority, Zambia&#x2019;s Muvi TV, Ghana&#x2019;s Joy Prime and Cameroon&#x2019;s Canal 2. The short film is also available on the popular pan-African video on demand platform, AfroLandTV. Work for the 2020 report, named Londa, started with a call for contributors. Londa, which means to defend or protect, echoes the call for the collective work of different stakeholders to protect the digital rights environment in Africa. The report analyses the state of digital rights and inclusion in 20 African countries and unpacks the use of policy and legislation in Africa making key recommendations for improving the digital rights landscape.

Media and Publicity Engagements 
(a) Media Parleys: We held two media parleys, beginning with a physical media parley in Lagos, Nigeria, in January 2020, where we discussed the elements of the project with the media. The second media parley couldn&apos;t hold physically because of the COVID-19 imposed restrictions so it was hosted virtually.
(b) Online Advertisements: We created audiovisual content that enabled us to run adverts on all our social media platforms (Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn).
(c) Newspaper Advertisements: We ran newspaper advertisements on the proposed Social Medial bill in Nigeria and also ran advertisements condemning civic restrictions as the government clamped down on citizen rights during the #EndSARS protests. During the implementation of
COVID-19 lockdowns, we continued to advocate for the government to ensure rights-respecting measures and recognise that the virus, not citizens, is the enemy. 
(d) Radio Advertisement: We ran infomercials on 3 radio stations in Abuja for one week and its focus and messaging were towards pushback on the anti-social media bill. We also started a  #SayNoToSocialMediaBill radio tour that featured PIN team members and partners discussing the need for rights-respecting approach to legislative proposals on radio stations in Abia, Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Ebonyi, Edo, Enugu, FCT, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Sokoto and Yobe states.

Digital Rights Violation Reporting Platform RIPOTI
RIPOTI, the web platform for reporting digital rights violations and connecting with partners to seek redress has been completed and was launched on April 30, 2020, during the closing session of the 2021 Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum. The platform is being used to report, document, and process human rights violations online. It serves as a platform for collaborative intervention, research, and a safe place for whistleblowing around state induced clampdowns against freedom of expression.


Digital Rights Toolkit: AYETA
We believe in a world where everyone (young people, parents, educators, policymakers, stakeholders) will gradually become actors in securing a better online experience. The Ayeta toolkit was developed with the overarching aim of addressing the growing need to safeguard digital rights defenders, journalists, whistleblowers, and others working with sensitive information in the global South. Paradigm Initiative (PIN) is dedicated to making the toolkit user friendly and ensuring it remains a living resource by making newer versions available annually.

Capacity Building 
We reached 45 civil society organizations in our 3-day workshop held in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, in February 2020, before Nigeria announced its lockdown measures against the Covid-19. We had planned 3 workshops in the year 2020 with different focus groups (civil society, the judiciary, and law enforcement agencies). To this end, we rescheduled the rest of the capacity-building engagements proposed for the project to 2021 to enable us to reach
targeted groups such as the judiciary and the Nigerian security agencies. 

Strategic Litigation 
We continue to employ strategic litigation as one of our advocacy tools because when done right, it has proved to be a powerful instrument for the enforcement of rights as well as a reminder to the government that they are accountable to the people. In most cases where we do not make progress at desired paces, we at least achieved the objective of raising the profile of the cases and attracting media coverage. For the period under review, we filed court cases in support of wrongfully accused #EndSARS protesters, we issued a joint statement calling for respect for citizens&#x2019; rights during protests and challenged the violation of citizens&apos; rights. 

Communications
For effective communication of project activities and objectives, we implemented media and communication activities to support the work and facilitate joint/communal action, reaching different stakeholders with relevant messages. We hosted physical and virtual media briefings and produced communication contents such as infographics and audio-visuals and ran online and traditional media advertisements.

Global Convenings (RightsCon and Freedom Online Conference)
Participation in relevant and strategic global convenings was proposed as part of the project. The objective of our participation is to provide a platform to present our research and advocacy work to a global audience, learn from best practices across the world and benefit from diverse expertise available at such meetings. We have participated in two out of four convenings proposed and we have hosted three side sessions dedicated to our work on these platforms. We will be participating at RightsCon in June 2021 and Freedom Online Conference later in the year.

Risks, Challenges and Mitigating Measures
The unprecedented episode of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a major disruption to most organizations&#x2019; calendars and programming and Paradigm Initiative was not spared. Consequently, activities were either suspended, cancelled or postponed causing a low rate of depletion for this project. The financial excesses reported for Year 1 are mostly as a result of activities not yet carried out due to the COVID-19 restrictions but are now set to be implemented in Year 2, as indicated in the annual plan. While some project activities were interrupted by the COVID-19 lockdowns, we have not departed from the theory of change as we continued to ensure that online activities helped drive home our message about the need to create safe spaces online. Noting that learning, work and most other activities moved online because of the global pandemic, we believe that this strongly supports our assertion about the huge importance of online civic spaces, and the need to protect them.

Sustainability Plan

Our sustainability plan is built around developing a community of partners and organisations with shared goals and objectives. We position ourselves for funding and institutional support by demonstrating leadership in our field through our research and advocacy work. We continue to offer value and engage broadly, bringing attention to our work in relevant circles. One of the key post-activities of PIN&#x2019;s events, especially workshops, is to invite participants to join the NetRights coalition which we manage and where we continue to share with, and learn from, coalition members. This helps us to keep the engagement going beyond each project lifetime. In addition to these, sustainability in this project will be guaranteed based on the following:

(a) Paradigm Initiative has been active on the Internet Freedom scene in Africa for over 10 years, and has acquired the reputation of impact in delivering Internet freedom programmatic interventions across the continent, including in work related to this project&#x2019;s activities. During this process, we have also forged partnerships with organizations within Nigeria, such as the Nigerian Network of NGOs, Digital Rights Lawyers Initiative, Citizens&#x2019; Gavel, among others, which has increased the impact of our work. 
(b) Our Internet freedom interventions across Africa over the past 10 years has involved the train-the-trainer model. Our programmatic interventions have involved identifying long-term partners and training in-country civil society organisations so that they can use new knowledge gained and resources to train others. This process continues to produce a ripple effect that effectively multiplies our impact and ensures that our work is sustainable even if particular programs have ended.
(c) Paradigm Initiative has multiple and diverse long-term funding partners that support our work for the foreseeable future. For example, our grant relationship with Ford Foundation is within the framework of the BUILD grant, which provides 5 years of institutional support for our work; we have a 2-year grant, covering 5 countries, with the United States&#x2019; Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; and we are part of the 3-year Greater Internet Freedom project supported by the United States Agency for International Development.

Pending Activities and Implementation Plan
As part of the contingency plan we submitted in earlier reports, we increased the number of people to be reached in 2021, to be able to achieve the objectives of our capacity building programs of organising workshops for civil society actors, law enforcement officers, and Judiciary officials, in the second and third quarters of 2021. Also, the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum held in April 2021 with an increased level of involvement to cater for the cancelled 2020 event and we are currently converting the Digital Rights in Africa Report into a short film as we did in 2020. 

Conclusion
We are excited by the level of implementation of this project despite the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are on course to achieve a 100% implementation of the grant and cannot wait to measure the impact of the project on the landscape for freedom of expression online in Nigeria and beyond. We remain committed to the objectives of this project beyond 2021. We are grateful for the kind support extended to us by the Embassy and we look forward to a long and sustained relationship and sharing our goals and focus in the coming years.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to increase awareness and respect for online freedom of expression by carrying out activities that educate, inform, influence, and support the implementation of policies, laws, and practices on the subject matter. The project is addressing the identified problem by constructively engaging relevant stakeholders on the said subject; planning information sessions, discussions, and training for the judiciary and law enforcement agencies; organizing awareness training and workshops for media practitioners and ordinary citizens; employing effective advocacy strategies to ensure that proposed legislation that hurt freedom of expression is not passed; influencing the passage of positive rights legislation; utilizing the Freedom of Information Act to formally seek information regarding actual or potential freedom of expression infringements; instituting lawsuits against violators of online freedom of expression; and creating a systematic way of identifying, reporting and addressing violations of rights to freedom of expression online. The project is expected to significantly change the overall outlook towards digital engagement in Nigeria by reducing the climate of fear around freedom of expression online and creating safer spaces for dissidents, disadvantaged groups and minority groups who face huge discrimination on the basis of their opinion, beliefs, sexuality or gender.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project &#x2018;&#x2019;Ensuring Effective Implementation of Programmes, Policies and Legislations, that Contribute Towards Achieving Gender Equality in Nigeria by 2030&#x201D; was conceived to address the challenges of the address the gaps in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women. The project commenced in 2016 and ended in 2020.  Based on the prevailing   institutional gaps in achieving gender equality and empowerment of women, Benue and Zamfara State were the target locations for the project. Advocacies were conducted to traditional leaders, Members of parliament, Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), Political parties to get their support for their project. 

Key Outcome and Results: Three arenas of achievements in of the project may be cited: development of policies, program and legislations that are gender responsive; generation of policy documents that support advocacy to decision makers, inclusion of the needs of women and girls in the public budgets, emergency of women&#x2019;s movement and tools, knowledge and skills were gained by members of parliament, Ministries, Agencies and departments on gender responsive programmes, legislations and policies. Civil Society Organisations also gained knowledge and skills on gender programming, gender budgeting and Sustainable Development goals.

At the policy level, the project generated policy, programmes and legal reforms that contributed to the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls in Benue and Zamfara State. In Zamfara State, automatic employment was granted to female corps members in the State Ministry of Justice. Based on the project advocacies, three hundred (300) community women received training for community nursing and midwifery. Five hundred (500) women have been empowered with monetary supports to boost their businesses; Six (6) women appointed as special advisers in government agencies, twenty (20) girls were granted scholarships to study in various institutions outside Nigeria and the First Female Chief Judge was appointed. The project also led to the creation of grassroots women&#x2019;s movement with eight hundred (800) members in eight local governments.  The bill affirmative action for inclusion of women in public leadership was presented to the house and sponsor was identified. Civil society organization&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s movement advocated for execution of two (2) projects in their community. In Benue State Women head strategic committees in Benue State House of Assembly Committee Chairperson on Appropriation and Chairperson Sustainable Development Goals and Development Cooperation; Seven women were elected as Local Government Chairpersons, three Deputy Chairpersons and Nin In the State Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperatives, twenty (20) female community development workers were employed , seven (7) women promoted as Directors. Two (2) laws that are gender responsive were passed, the Violence Against Persons Prohibitions Law and Administration of Criminal Justice (ACJA). Ten (10) cases of sexual abuse were prosecuted under the VAPP law. Ten thousand people were reached through media radio sensitsation programmes on the VAPP and ACJA. Grassroots women&#x2019;s movement with five hundred (500) members in eight local governments was created.
The project encountered challenges in the course of implementation. The high level of insecurity in the States affected implementation of activities, insufficient budget allocation to the needs of women and girls, delay by government bureaucracy and political instability and COVID-19 affected the flow of activities, the patriarchal norms and change of political leadership was the major constraint to the passage of affirmative action law. To address these challenges, it was recommended that future funding programs  should support legislative frameworks such as Gender Budget Act, which enshrines a law specifying budgetary provisions to address the needs of women, girls and persons living with disabilities.   Grassroots Women&#x2019;s movement engaged political leaders, demanded and got their needs included in the State budget.  In order to consolidate on the gains made, future interventions should prioritize capacity building of grassroots women&#x2019;s movement on organising feminist movements.   Programmes should be tailored  around capacity building of these women to prepare them for political leadership. In the future funding priorities should also be designed to pass the affirmative action law in Zamfara and other Northern States in Nigeria.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair Finance Asia Program (FFA) envisages to reduce the negative impact of national and cross-border bank investments in Asia on human rights, the environment and climate change, and to increase adequate financial services for pro-poor, inclusive economic development. The goal is to establish a sustainable financial sector in Asia, with financial sector institutions operating at national and regional level being more transparent and accountable and adhering to Economic, Social and Governance (ESG)-criteria. FFA is funded by SIDA.

In Pakistan, this project is led by Indus Consortium (IC), which envisions a democratic and equitable society where all citizens enjoy equal economic, cultural and political rights. Indus Consortium works for local communities to enhance their resilience and participation in development.

In Pakistan, major decisions around investments are made by the global head offices of the IFIs. 90% of the total investment/ loaning goes to Pakistan government with 100% sovereign secure loaning whereas banks exclusively deal with clients and are often responsible to contributor to fuel in inequality. About 100 million adults in Pakistan don&#x2019;t have access to formal and regulated financial services. This number accounts for about 5% of the world&#x2019;s unbanked population, which stands at 2 billion

Having a formal and regulated transaction account opens access to other financial services, such as savings, payments, insurance and credit, all of which can help people better manage their lives and reduce poverty. However, only 20% Pakistanis have formal bank account (including digital mobile accounts) whereas only 5% women are included in the financial sector. We see Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) are heavily under-financed as more of the lending goes to government and large scale industry whileSMEs are receiving only a small chunk of 7 % of total lending, given the fact that there are total 3.2 million SMEs registered in Pakistan, however approximately 188,000 SMEs are getting loans as per banking books . These evidences suggests that common citizens, SMEs and small scale private sector is lacking financial inclusion where more than 50% banking investment directly goes to government through T-Bills . Lending priorities seem to exhibit extreme consumer liabilities instead of providing sustainable development i.e., Corporate insurance, farmers investment insurance etc as there is high interest ratio in Pakistan i.e., 7% at current, however before Covid pandemic it was at 13%. A deeper analysis suggests the primary motive for investment is to transfer finances through legal measures to oversees tax heavens such as the Cayman Island, Singapore, Dubai etc.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) refers to investment standards, which socially conscious financial institutions must apply to screen potential investments (financing). Environmental regulations refer to criteria in place for financial institutions to minimize the environmental risks by promoting environmental friendly financial regulations for banks and non-bank financial institutions. Social criteria for investment refers to relationship with employees, suppliers, customers and communities. Governance criteria refers to corporate governance including leadership, executive pay, internal controls, audits and shareholder rights.
The State Bank of Pakistan is not only the central bank but is also the regulator of commercial and microfinance banks in Pakistan. Likewise, the Securities and Exchange Commission is the regulator for non-bank financial institutions including the investment banks.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IWRAW AP proposes to partner with AIPP, APNSW, APRRN, APTN, APWWDU represented by STEP, ASC, IDPC Asia and ILGA Asia (ILGA will notreceive financial support, but will contribute network resource and professional support) - eight networks and organisations in Asia advocating for the rights of women facing multiple forms of discrimination. The joint project will aim at strengthening intersectional movement building in Asia as the key to developing transformative advocacy strategies that center the voices and lived experiences of diverse groups of marginalised women and challenge multiple systems of oppression to achieve systemic gender equality. Targetcountries for this project will be Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, India and Pakistan, with regional and global spheres of impact. We have updated our focus countries to include Cambodia and Pakistan and to exclude Nepal and Thailand, as multiple consortiumpartners have strong national partnerships in Cambodia and Pakistan and interest from country partners to engage in this project. Additionally, we sought to prioritise Voice focus countries in the final selection. The project addresses the Voice impact theme: space for political participation and citizen engagement. Over the 33-month period, the project partners will organise online and offline activities to: build our collective capacities on intersectionality theory and practice; understand how to engage in CEDAW advocacy and activism from an intersectional perspective;facilitate capacity buildingand intersectional movement building among national partners in all five target countries; reflect on our experiences of seeking to apply intersectionality in advocacy and movement building, and document these practices; engage in strategising and advocacy planning to offer a collective andsystems response to specific manifestations of gender equality;develop an intersectional feminist, cross-movement advocacy roadmap, addressing issues such as bodily rights, health rights, migrant rights, digital rights,decriminalisation and decarceration; network and build cross-movement solidarity at regional level;support national partners to put into practice collective, intersectional advocacy, research or campaignactions; and create and share knowledge with our movements on practical ways to apply intersectionality in advocacy, movement building and organisational practices, through creative communications. The specific results we will deliver include: Strengthened collective understanding of intersectionality and intersectional feminism among nine key networks and organisations working to eradicate gender inequality in Asia Regional and national cross-movement roadmaps for joint advocacy outlining intersectional entry points for collective action towards eliminating gender inequality Documented good practices and strategies for applying an intersectional approach to eliminating gender inequality in Asia Due to COVID-19 and related restrictions, activities taking place over the first 18 months will be organised virtually. We will strengthen our own capacities to organise online by undergoing training on digital advocacy, and digital and holistic security during the inception phase. In order to overcome challenges to wellbeing and inter-personal connection posed byprolonged COVID-19 measures, we will organise quarterly wellness sessions involving activities such as meditation, online workouts, group discussions, etc. Seeking to ensure accessibility for all, we have dedicated a standard amount in all activitybudgets to meet accessibility needs ranging from audiovisual aids to language interpretation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Women&apos;s Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Womens Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific (IWRAW Asia Pacific) was founded in 1993 to work towards the realisation of the human rights of women through the use of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (the CEDAW Convention) and other international human rights instruments. The founders, a group of Asian women, wanted to link activism takingplace at the local level with that at the global level. By understanding and participating in international activities, women working at the local level would be able to monitor and facilitate the implementation of the CEDAW Convention domestically while contributing to standard-setting at the international level. Thirteen years later, IWRAW Asia Pacific works in 14countries in South and Southeast Asia and over 100 countries globally.
Phase 1: 1993-1996
In the first four years of its existence, IWRAW Asia Pacific worked towards strengthening national womens groups and alliances in Asia that could carry out and sustain CEDAW Convention-related work. The focus of the activities was centred on creating clarity of concepts pertaining to womens rights, especially the key principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, state obligation and accountability andthe expanded concept of womens rights as human rights. IWRAW Asia Pacific focused on inspiring womens groups to co-ordinate their work within a rights framework. It began looking at developing methodologies for analysing the various sites of discrimination, for developing holistic measures for achieving de facto equality of women and for training womens rights advocates on the CEDAW Convention and on claiming rights inside and outside courtprocedures. Due to its rights focus, IWRAW Asia Pacific was involved in regional and international advocacy, for instance, in the NGO preparations and participation in the International Conference on Population and Development in 1993, and the World Conference onWomen in Beijing in 1995.
Phase 2: 1997-2002
IWRAW AsiaPacific sharpened its approaches in bringing about domestic application of international human rights norms. It continued to prioritise creating and deepening conceptual clarity but now focused also on concretising this conceptual clarity through the development of methodologies for identifying and addressing discrimination against women in its various contexts, i.e. a monitoring tool to assess compliance with the CEDAW Convention, as well as on process and advocacy necessary for holding states accountable for violations.
IWRAW Asia Pacific continued to put strong focus on national-level capacity-building through social investigation visits, two regional trainings of trainers, national-level trainings, and issue-based technical assistance, among others.However, as a parallel indispensable strategy, we also facilitated a process by which national groups were able to build their own capacity through research-based advocacy, which also enabled them to participate in regional and international level advocacy. This move was made in the belief that activities at the national and international levels are interlinked and complementary. It ensures the bridging of the disconnect between the activities at the national and international levels.
Phase 3: 2003-2005
IWRAW Asia Pacific identified new areas of concern for this phase. At this stage, national groups were much more aware of the importance of the Convention and were engaging in activism at the international level as part of the larger strategy of promotingand claiming womens human rights at the national level. As a result, IWRAW Asia Pacific, in addition to continuing its focus on conceptual clarity and testing methodologies, expanded its work to:
- support the international work of its national partnersand constituencies;
- sustain advocacy to further understanding and domestic application of the principles of non-discrimination and equality;
-focus on providing technical assistance to national womens groups, including those in other regions, instead of organising trainings for them. In this way, local groups take ownership over the program by becoming responsible for securing funding for local costs of the training and crafting their own objectives and vision for the event; and
- develop a pool ofresource persons and trainers to assist in our technical assistance and capacity-building work.
As the CEDAW Committee and other human rights bodies progressively interpreted human rights standards in ways that complemented and crosscut their areas ofwork,IWRAW Asia Pacific engaged in advancing and integrating womens concerns into all human rights monitoring bodies. Our engagement here included:
- enhancing IWRAW Asia Pacificsadvocacy with regard to other treaty bodies, the UN Commission on Human Rights(now the Human Rights Council), and the UN Special Rapporteurs;
- integrating information on other major treaties and international and regional mechanisms into our national capacity-building component;
- developing a better understanding of womens economic, social and cultural rights; and
-  strengthening partnerships with mainstream human rights organisations working internationally and regionally.

IWRAW Asia Pacific focuses on women and womens NGOs from the South. We work primarily throughcollaborative projects at the international, national and local levels with women activists and NGOs; human rights advocates; lawyers; governments and international organisations.
As stated above, one reason for IWRAW Asia Pacifics uniqueness lies in its positioning as an international NGO based in the Global South, rather than in Geneva or New York. This positioning and our close contacts with local NGOs allow us to ground our analytical approach in the realities of NGOs and activists in the South sothat we canbetter address the structural causes that permit the violation of rights. Through this informed approach, we examine underlying causes of rights violations and strengths and weaknesses of State efforts and identify factors that are needed to create a culture of compliance with human rights norms and institutional frameworks and legal instruments that are needed for the administration of justice. This allows us to develop programs that aim at developing the capacity of people to claim rights and strengthenthe institutional framework necessary for this.

In addition, the strength of IWRAW Asia Pacifics positioning lies in the fact that we do not take up the causes of national level NGOs, but rather aim to play an enabling and facilitating role tobuild the capacity of local level activists to take up their causes directly and to participate in both their national debates and in international processes. Our programs relating to international human rights norms have brought greater cohesion toactivism at the national level. The presence of national level NGOs at international processes have earned them greater credibility and legitimacywith their own governments.
In addition, IWRAW Asia Pacific has a unique position with regard to the Committeeon the Elimination ofDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee), the treaty body that oversees compliance by States parties to the CEDAW Convention,in that the UN Division for the Advancement of Women has named IWRAW Asia Pacific as the official channelforpassing alternative information from NGOs to the CEDAW Committee when those NGOs governments are reporting. This provides IWRAW Asia Pacific with greater insight into the workings of the Committee and gives local NGOs greater access to the Committee and Committee members because they have an international NGO that is advocating for their participation in the CEDAW reporting process. The alternative information provided by national level NGOs institutes a necessary system of checks and balances, strengtheningpolitical constituencies and increasing the demand for greater transparency and accountability from governments.</narrative>

The curriculum will be available for the  website and through the press. The partner then will introduce and distribute thecurriculum to their alumni and partner organizations via announcing this through email, website and social media. After that there will have a soft launch via online. There will be a plan to have a short webinar to introduce this curriculum to the partners and will consider to choose some activities from the curriculum that are suitable for doing online training for their partners or public. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the travelling is very restricted because of the pandemic which we do not know when it is going to end. Therefore, Online training, for partners, will be one option to do after it is completed. Of course, for the next phase or in thefuture, the partner hope to organize the Training of Trainers (ToT) by using this curriculum for the partners and alumni as regional.

The key strategies activities are the following:

1. Develop the curriculum
2. Organize ToT and training youth to be gender and environmental trainers
3. Conduct research on gender and water governance (action research and community-based research)
4. Organizephysical workshops and meetings for communities (exchange programs for Thai and Burmese civils society groups and marginalized communities along the Salween and Mekong rivers).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia Joint Response 2021</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia&#x2019;s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks (&#x2018;triple threat&#x2019; &#x2013; locust, drought, COVID-19): the Desert Locust upsurge that started in late 2019  and continues to threaten the food security and livelihoods of pastoralists and farmers in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas; the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts both in Somalia and globally; and the extended impact of previous shocks (flooding, drought, displacement, etc.) on livelihoods.
Assessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) andFamine Early Warning SystemsNetwork (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020. In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3)outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeastern Somalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.
Besides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.
Our proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).
Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HAVOYOCO was set up in 1992 by a group of young people from Hargeisa in Somaliland. The organisation&apos;s focus is on education, empowerment and creating opportunities for young people and women to provide in their own livelihood. HAVOYOCO is involved in (a) vocational training, literacy and numeracy activities for internally displaced (IDPs) and returnee women and young girls, constructing low-cost houses for IDPs in Hargeisa, (b) community awareness campaigns on HIV and AIDS prevention and reducing stigmatisation, malaria prevention and treatment, peace building and human rights awareness, mainly through circus and drama shows, (c) pastoral developmentsuch as livelihood support, health for people and livestock, the capacity building of pastoral organisations in villages, restocking and environmental protection, and (d) humanitarian interventions such as the rehabilitation of water sources, water trucking and the distribution of pack camels to pastoralist households. Its operational areas include all Somaliland regions and the Somali regionof Ethiopia.
The relationship with Oxfam Novib began in 1997 when Oxfam Novib and its Ethiopian counterpart Circus Ethiopia visitedHargeisa. In 1998 Oxfam Novib funded HAVOYOCO&apos;s organisation costs and a literacy project for youths. Oxfam Novib has also funded asoap-making centre, management and literacy courses, and income generating activities around the soap factory.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia Joint Response 2021</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia&#x2019;s population is currently experiencing multiple shocks (&#x2018;triple threat&#x2019; &#x2013; locust, drought, COVID-19): the Desert Locust upsurge that started in late 2019  and continues to threaten the food security and livelihoods of pastoralists and farmers in many parts of the country; riverine and flash floods that affect the food security, livelihoods and safety of farmers and people living in flood-prone, populated areas; the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that is having severe health and socio-economic impacts both in Somalia and globally; and the extended impact of previous shocks (flooding, drought, displacement, etc.) on livelihoods.
Assessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) andFamine Early Warning SystemsNetwork (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020. In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3)outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeastern Somalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.
Besides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.
Our proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).
Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">KAALO Aid and Development is a non-profit humanitarian and development organization established in Somalia in 1991 just after the collapse of the central government. KAALO works in Nugal, Mudug, Bari, Sool, Sanaag and Karkaar regions and plans to expand services to cover more regions of Somalia.

KAALO#s vision is a #Society free of ignorance and poverty# and its mission is to improve the livelihoods of communities in Somalia by supporting the provision of basic needs in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner. Currently the key program areas for KAALO are education and research, democracy, human rights, governance and rule of law, livelihood and community empowerment, agriculture and rural infrastructure, health water and sanitation. Current funding partners for KAALO include UNHCR, UNHABITAT, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), Diakonia, Danish People#s Aid (DPA), Oxfam Novib and Caritas International Belgium.

KAALO has been in partnership with Oxfam since 2006. They were an implementing partner with Oxfam Novib for several long term development projects among them the Human rights program #2006-2008# which was funded by the EC, they are also currently implementing on two big projects both funded by the EC: #Strengthening capacity of civil society organisations to provide life skills and vocational training for the youth# and #Support to Artisanal Fisheries and Coastal Management in Somaliland and Puntland#

KAALOhas registered the following key achievements to date:

# Undertook the largest program that a Civil Society Organization implemented in Puntland. This involved distribution of about 60 tonnes of books, journals, hospital beds, other hospital equipments, wheelchairs, crutches e.t.c. to Somali communities across Somalia in 2001. Counterpart International in Washington USA contributed the shipment.
# Carried out the first public building relocation program since the collapse of the last Central government in 1993 - 94 in Nugal region of Somalia.
# Established the first professional training institute, Garowe School of Management, in Puntland in 1999. Renamed Puntland Community College in 2001 and grew to become Puntland State University in 2004.
# Implemented the first Puntland administration funded community project (Drought Relief Program) during the 2003 # 04 drought in Puntland.

Assessments by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) andFamine Early Warning SystemsNetwork (FEWSNET) also indicate that, in the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through December 2020. In addition, 849 900 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through August 2021 . Crisis (IPC Phase 3)outcomes are expected from June to September in parts of central Somalia, where livestock holdings are lowest, and in northeastern Somalia, where the economy is more dependent on livestock, seafood, and frankincense exports. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 have led to a 30-50 % decline in annual external remittances, an anticipated25-35 % decline in annual livestock exports, lower labour demand, and above average imported staple food prices.
Besides adverse weather conditions and conflict resulting in food insecurity and hunger, other prevailing challenges in the project areas Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO work are poor access to water and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as displacement. Against this backdrop,  the proposed activities aim at assisting both IDPs and host communities. Access to clean and safe water is a major area of concern in our intervention areas in Somaliland and Puntland.
Our proposed activities focus on relieving the distress suffered by affected families, preventing their situation from getting worse and strengthening collective resilience mechanisms. In terms of sectors we will focus on Food Security &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Livelihoods (FSL), Water, Sanitation &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Hygiene (WASH), Protection (PRO), Multi-Purpose Cash (MPCT) and Accountability (ACC).
Oxfam and partners Candlelight, Havoyoco and KAALO will work in the following regions and districts/locations: Awdal (Baki), Sool (Las Anod, Xudun, Bocaame), Sanaag (Eerigavo), Bari (Bossaso), Mudug (Jariiban). Partners have been implementing SOMJR activities in these regions and locations since 2019 (Awdal, Sool, Sanaag) and 2020 (Bari, Mudug), and were able to invest in the resilience building of target communities. Bocaame in Sool has been added as a new location to the SOMJR: it has already been targeted by partner KAALO during the DRA-funded Desert Locust Joint Response (May to October 2020), however, needs remain high as Bocaame is highly affected by insecurity and recurring waves of desert locust invasions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Candle Light for Health and Education (CLHE) works in the Toghdeer region of Somalia and was founded in 1995. Its mandate is to contribute to setting up sustainable structures in education and healthcare.
Its most important target group consists of women and other marginalised groups, such as returning refugees. CHLE is also working with former militia members and tries to integrate them in society.
CLHE works closely with the local authorities, leaders and others. Its work includes formal and informaleducation, training,preventive healthcare, rehabilitating small school buildings, and small-scale income generating activities. CLHE also works on the environment. It is of the opinion that deforestation has a negative impact on cattle, which has negative consequences for people&apos;s health and nutrition. Not enough good grazing land and a lack of water increase people&apos;s mobility, disrupting education programs.
Therelationship between Oxfam Novib and CLHE began in 1996. CLHE&apos;s organisation capacities havesince improved.</narrative>

Results 1: Community level surveillance on COVID-19 response strengthened.
The project hopes to establish an effective surveillance system to detect and manage suspected cases effectively without stigmatizing the suspects or creating conflict in the community. The specific activities are:
Activity 1.1: Train VHTs, LCs &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; RWCs  onCOVID 19 response.
VHTs, LCs andRWCs are front-liners in COVID 19 response. The project will collaborate with the task force to train the VHTs, LCs and RWCs on COVID-19 preparedness, risk mapping and response actions in line with MOH SOPs and Protocols. This willbe a maximum of three-hourtraining sessions with 10 participants per session. In total five sessions will be held in three days to equip them to detect and report suspected cases for further investigation, distribute hand-washing facilities to targeted households, markets andhealth centres.

Activity 1.2: Conduct COVID-19 risk mapping.
This will be a basic data collection process on risky behaviors, hotspots, new arrivals, community suspected cases, etc. The project will provide VHTs with case definition tools and referral forms to enable reporting to health facilities for immediate action. Suspected cases will be documented and handled according to COVID-19 response protocol.

Activity 1.3: Procure and provide assorted items to COVID-19 task force for surveillance.
The project will provide one-off support in form of fuel, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and assorted sanitary items to facilitate district and sub county COVID-19 task force.

Result 2: Enhanced communication and social mobilization capacity to respond tothe COVID-19 pandemic
The result will be achieved through community engagement, social and behavior change communication practices. The specific activities are as below:

Field(s) of activity: PALM Corps is permitted/Licenced by NGO Bureau to operate in West Nile, and Northern Uganda. Butcurrently the operations are limited to West Nile.  The sectors are Agriculture and Livelihoods, Primary Education, Nutrition, WASHand Environment.
4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
The influx of refugees in West Nile has attracted a couple of humanitarian and development organizations who areproviding social services to the refugees and the host community to complement on government efforts. With the localization policy of the government of Uganda, this presents opportunities for local organizations to partner with the international organizations to participate in responding to the crisis and development challenges in the region. The demand for social services in huge especially in the refugee settlements where access to and quality of education, health services and food is a problem. WFP provides food or cash for refugees to buy food. The prices of food items increased as result of the influx and unfortunately the local population is not responding adequately to produce food to meet the demand. The region is still net importer of food itemsespecially vegetables, beans and maize from other regions of Uganda and DRC.  PALM has rich experience of value chain development and facilitation of multi-stakeholder processes which makes the organization attractive to several development actors.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AHEDI- UG is an Organization formed by young university graduates in the field of law and social work in July 2008 to promote, defend and protect rights of every citizen regardless of tribe and nationality; #Justice for All#. The organization has mainstreamed itsactivities in the area of GBV/VAWG, PHA victims, Women and children in conflict with the law, Land rights, Legal and social consultancy for Local governments (on Policy and legal Issues) and other vulnerable persons, working towards improving the legal framework and awareness on human rights and fundamental freedom, land and property rights.
AHEDI-UG delivers holistic and citizen friendly programs with particular emphasis on GBV/VAWG,HIV/AIDs, emergency response to humanitarian issues, land rights/property ownership, psycho-social support, legal and social consultancy that leads to  sustainable development and livelihood.
AHEDI-UG works with a number of partners in the execution of its mission including political and technocrats at the districts of west Nile sub region and Uganda at large, members of parliament (MP), traditional leaders, central government representatives, other NGOs, CBOs and Faith base leaders among others.
The turning point in the development of this Organization came in 2010 when West Nile civil society organizations identified the Organization to Coordinate We Can Campaign Project Funded by Oxfam in West Nile, (thus bringing all West Nile GBV actors together both state and none state Actors) a program that ran for 6 years in which AHEDI-UG mobilized and brought together 169 state and non-state GBV actors and with them, recruited 16,000 charge makers across all the districts of West Nile Nile. Although the project ended, AHEDI- UG  has managed to sustain this members through various advocacy engagements resulting to enactments of 7 (seven) district level ordinances to address a base line campaign findings carried in 2013 under Oxfam funded We Can Campaign.
To date, AHEDI- UG has continued to build on this coalition to address GBV issues in the region and now, the Organization is, in Partnership with EU, implementing 923,730,000/ project to empower Women Market vendors in Arua District to end GBV, a project that arose out of We Can Campaign Base line survey supra.

ACTIVITIES
Objective: 1 To increase community risk communication and engagement against COVID-19 pandemic among refugees and host communities in Koboko district
A 1:1 Creation of a community perception tracking tool (CPT) through whichcommunity rumors, beliefs, ideas, concerns etc. are collected, presented and analyzed for discussion in coordination meetings.
Community perception trackingtool will be developed by PICOT MEAL officer in consultation with Oxfam. The tool will be used to track the ongoing rumors, ideas, beliefs, associated myths and concerns relating to COVID-19 and the ongoing response by government. It will be administered by PICOTvolunteers in the most suitable method without risking the available guidelines issued byMinistry of Health. Emphasis will be put to ensure volunteers observe maximum infection prevention control measures. It#s anticipated that this activity will give an opportunity to engage local communities (with focus to vulnerable) to share their views on the current response by government, communities as well as their coping mechanisms. Through this activity valid data is obtained to inform response messaging as regards myths and beliefs, redesign strategies and respond to urgent issues affecting thecommunities.

A 1:2 Run spot messages, drama and adverts in local languages on local radios guided by WHO and MoH guidelines.
PICOT together with the partner (Spirit Fm) will run radio spot messages, Deejay Mentions and adverts in selected local languagesin line with ministry of health guidelines.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Partners In Community Transformation (PICOT) is non-profit making Organization founded in 2005 by a group of progressive youth graduates as a CBO in the names of Koboko Youth In Development (KOYID).  The overall goal then was to address development challenges in health (HIV/AIDS) education and lack of skills among youths, women and other vulnerable communities in Koboko District specifically.Due to growth in capacity and programming, in 2013, the organization was registered with National NGO board as PICOT and licensed to work in west nile region. At this point strategic decisions were made to review the vision, mission and strategic objective, expand geographical coverage and thematic focus to include humanitarian response given PICOT#s geographical location along the border of three countries (Uganda, DR Congo and South Sudan). This strategic transformation witnessed changes in organizations# policies. PICOT embarked on a rigorous process of policy review and development. Most notably is the gender policy, work place HIV policy, safe guarding policy and the minimum humanitarian standards guidelines. It was also at this point that PICOT got its first female executivedirector. PICOT continues to pay special attention to gender integration in its institutional growth and program design and implementation to realize its overall vision of holistically transformed communities.

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? &apos;In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?
PICOT as an organization emerged from the very social, political and economic challenges vulnerable communities face on daily basis however these challenges have continued to affect lives of vulnerable people at different lengths and period often caused by social, economic and political factors and because of community#s vulnerabilities, they have not responded well to the shocks brought about by such eventualities hence their livelihood and social wellbeing is ever threatened.PICOT positions its self to mobilize local communities, empower and support them as chage agents to spear head and address their own challenges in the 9 districts (Koboko, Arua, Yumbe, Adjumani, Zombo, Pakwach, Moyo, Nebbi and Maracha) of West Nile sub region, with the aim of not just providing services, but more importantly setting out to influence the sector of health, WASH, agriculture and education to be responsive tothe local needs.
Our five year strategic themes attest to our commitment to effectively deliver through our core functions of improved health services, education and skills development, improving Livelihood and environment and responding to humanitarian needs of the refugees and host communities.
Together with its partners PICOT will respond to the West Nile regions# sector challenges in Health, Education, Humanitarian response, Livelihoods and environment, by addressing issues of inequality in access, weak sustainabilitymechanisms, low investment in the selected sectors and governance concerns by strengthening transparency and accountability. As such, in the next five years PICOT will position itself as an advocate and direct service provider to work with the most vulnerable of communities which include Children in and out of school,Women, Persons with Disability, People Living with HIV/Aids, Internally Displaced People and refugees, and the elderly. Specifically, PICOT will focus on pathways that lead to improved interventions, give equal opportunities for women and men and ensurecommunities have equal access to service provision in West Nile region.
PICOT will continue working with meaningful partners with common values and principles at various levels among which include local NGOs, networks, governments, donors, private sector,academic and research institutions in a bid to achieve its vision.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014, we saw Refugee Youth being the victims of the conflict and all forms of violence#s in South Sudan while escaping the 2013 Crisis, during transits, in reception Centers and in the clusters where they were settled by Office Prime Minister. We understood that Peaceful coexistence, love hope and recovery was vital given the high level of trauma, communities need to have a strong voice tostand for their needs. The gap between NGOs and Refugee Youth in the communities has to be bridged in a conflict sensitive manner as well as recognizing the Youth as potential partners for Peace and that led to the foundation  of Youth Social Advocacy Team.
 In June 2015, Five Young people (John Jal Dak, Amuna Vivian, Jacob Nhial Bol, Tabule Geoffrey, Narcisse Bakouroua) came up with an idea of Advocating for Youth Voices calling for Peace in Rhino Camp luckily our Team leader john Jal Dak was nominated for the UNHCR  Global Refugee Youth Consultations (GRYC) and while the final report was released, we got our organization name was add the word #Youth# that excite us given our founders being all young people, we resolved to rename Social Advocacy Team as #Youth Social Advocacy Team# . In July 2016 Full constitution was drafted, membership was established and key Voluntary Positions of Chairperson, Vice, Secretary General, Treasurer and Information were fully established. In March 2017, we got our registration as a community based organization and during the Word Refuge Day 2017, we were offered Office Space by DRC,UNHCR and OPM Jointly in Ocea A Village behind CatholicChurch of Nationals, this was our first recognition as one of the first refugee led CBOs in Rhino to start freshly in Uganda. In September 2017, we got our first partnership with r0g Agency in Berlinto implement #defyhatenow project. The organization attracted 26Youth Volunteers but with only 4 Female Volunteers the lowest ever# but now we are happy that we have more than 10 females and Advocate for more in order to close the gap. YSAT is in a process of registering as a National NGO in Uganda and South Sudan.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS
We have created awareness about peaceful coexistence to over 10,000 Youth, Women and Children through open air Music concerts,Dialogues, and conferences since 2017 in RhinoCamp and Omugo Extension. YSAT initiated the resolution of Tika Refugee Conflict, calling for the first ever Inter Cultural Dialogue for South Sudanese Refugees targeting the 64 tribes of South Sudanese Refugees as Non Violent Action to reconcile and heal the broken relationship between the communities that fought, as we talk now, Tika was announced during the Peace Campaign we held in Ocea Zone in January 2019 as #Peaceful Zone# by OPM/UNHCR jointly. We were able to partner with 6 Renown National &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; International Organizations including Oxfam Novib, Norwegian Peoples Aid (NPA), and r0g Agency for Open Culture in Berlin, African Non Profit Chore (ANCHOR), The Nexus Fund, PeaceTech Lab. We were able to record 80,000 USD Grant Fundsin the 2018/19 Fiscal Yearfor YSAT.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT FOR RURAL DEV CEFORD</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The history of Community Empowerment for Rural Development (CEFORD) dates back to 1993 when the Uganda government, with the financial and technical support of the Dutch government, implemented the Community Action Program (CAP) and later the Women Empowerment Program (WEP) in the West Nile region. Both programs were considered successes by the communities and district local governments of West Nile, and external evaluators and the Dutch embassy in Uganda. The focus was on community mobilisation and capacity building through service delivery and the implementation of micro-projects. CAP concentrated on the supply of social infrastructure services and the implementation of agricultural projects, while WEP concentrated on the empowerment of women and the strengthening of their capacities to participate in the development process.
Thus CEFORD was founded, to fill the gap created by the closure of these successful programs that were phased out in June 2000. CEFORD operates in parts of all the five districts of Adjumani, Arua, Moyo, Nebbi and Yumbe.
It was founded in July 2000 but the process of its formation dates back to 1998, to an internal reflection workshop of CAP staff that identified possible scenarios for the future. One scenario suggested a merger of CAP and WEP into a local NGO.
The decentralisation of government to districts in Uganda also demanded strong civil society organisations that could support local governments indelivering services.
CEFORD&apos;s major achievements in the last three years include a participatory poverty assessment in the districts of Arua and Nebbi. Through these assessments CEFORD gave objective feedback from poor women and men to the district and central governments, and to some donor.
It was also successful in supporting the Adjumani district local government in facilitating the formulation of all its sub-county development plans. This enhanced its chance of accessing funds from the central government, from which the communities would benefit.
And CEFORD strengthened the capacities of four local organisations through organisational self-assessment and the facilitation of strategic planning. The performance of these organisations has since improved. It also mobilised and linked ten community-based organisations to funding for agricultural activities; over 30 million Ugandan shillings from the German Development Services.
CEFORD&apos;s Mission is to improve the capacity of women, men, children and their organisations in the more disadvantaged communities of West Nile effectively to articulate their demands and interests, to increase their production and income in a sustainable way and to secure better access to services.
The institutional objectives of CEFORD are to contribute to the following policy and practice changes in West Nile: food and income security is guaranteed, communities have positive attitude to the enrolment and retention of girls in schools, there is active participation of the population in district and sub-county planning and policy formulation (especially around issues of natural resources, peace and security),  peace and security in the region are consolidated especially at the household level, and women are empowered to participate as equal partners to men in decision-making and control over resources at the household and community levels.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PALM CORPs, People Empowering People(PEP) and Vision For Humanity(ViFoH) will implement the CTP project in aconsortium arrangement.
The consortium partners will organize an inception meeting to introduce the project to stakeholders and garner support for speedy implementation. The particiapnts will include; selected target beneficiaries (refugee and host), Local authorities, OPM UNHCR and other agencies implementing CTP such as DRC, NRC, Water Mission, Plan International, selected RWCs and LCs.

PALM Corps consortium willconduct awareness meetings in the areas targeted for the CTP activities. The focus will be on the planned cash transfer options, eligibility criteria, complaints and feedback mechanism that shall be employed by the project team. 60 key stakeholders including target beneficiaries (refugee and host), sector specialists local authorities sub county leaderships, OPM, UNHCR and other agencies implementing CTP will be part of the awareness meeting.The Consortium will obtain and verify listof PSNs/Extremely Vulnerable Individualfrom the OPM/UNHCR databases.  A well-defined eligibility criterion will be developed in consultation with Refugee Welfare Committees (RWC), OPM and UNHCR and communicated to the communities prior to the implementation of CTP. Actual selection of refugee households eligible for CTP will be done in consultation with the Refugee Welfare Committees (RWC), OPM and UNHCR. While for the host communities the consortium will work with LCs, Sector heads/specialists, local government leadership of Rigbo, Uriama and Odupi to select the beneficiaries.

The Consortium partners will conduct monthly partnership coordination meetings. The first meetings will be an in-house induction for consortium staff (both programme and finance staff engaged in this project) on the CTP approach of delivering assistance and CHS. The subsequent meetings will be held to share progress and review plans for subsequent months. In these meetings,partners will discuss budget performance and technicalactivity progress, share experiences, track fund utilization (BVA) and develop outlook for the next month. M&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;E Officer will present evidence-based performance indicators in the online M&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;E system (activity tracker). The purpose of end of project meeting isto review the project and decide what the organization can learn from it. It won&#x2019;t be a blame session. The product of the meeting will be lessons learned&#x2014;that will be available to future projects, partners and stakeholders. During the implementation, short videos will be produced for key activities, these will be shared during the close-out meeting. Twenty-five (25) participants including some key beneficiaries, and other partners will be invited to attend the meeting.

Strengthened access to basic food for selected vulnerable households for the farmers in Yelulu village. Apart from the vulnerability criteria the targeted households will be assessed on the basis of availability of land, proximity to the permanent water source (from R. Enyau and Yeluluriver) for offseason horticulture.
Agro-inputs will be provided to forty (40) selected beneficiaries using vouchers. The Consortium will organize meeting between the selected beneficiaries and Agro-input dealers to clarify procedures andvalidate preferred Agro-inputs.  PALM Corps and the District Agriculture officer of Terego district shall certify the inputs beforethey are picked by the farmers. During the market fair a desk will be set at the site for complain handling.The project will train beneficiaries in gardening in every household to grow quick maturing and nutritious vegetables to complement diet. The extension support will be home based and in mini groups of 3-5 members to minimize congregating farmers in groups in line with COVID19 controlmeasures.
Using conditional cash transfer, the project will support 35 selected most vulnerable households (PSN) with 5-liter jerrican for constructing tippy tap. Two - 20-liter jerricans for water storage per household and two bars of soap per month for three months. The 2 jerricans and the five-liter jerricans including soap will be acquired through the identified financial service provider. The construction of tippy tap will be through cash for work by selected youth in consultation with the trained VHTsand Local leaders trained under HRGF II. The organization will link the suppliers to the beneficiaries to access the items to support the targeted households.

The project will procure and distribute PPE to consortium partner staff and other selectedagencies that will support the project implementation, like the private financial service providers against COVID 19. The key PPE will include standard face masks, hand sanitizers and liquid soap. Each staff will be given 3 masks and hand sanitizers tocarrywhile implementing project activities toprotect them and beneficiaries.
Routine awareness campaigns against COVID19 and SGBV will be conducted by the trained VHTs (under HRGF II) in collaboration with sub county Health Assistants and monitored bytheRWCs and LCs. For SGBV, 2 days training will be organized for protection committees (20) to create awareness and follow up cases. Community Development Officers from local government will routinely mentor them. Cases of child protection (involving pupils) will be linked to Child Protection Officer under sister projects of PALM Corps (synergy). The volunteers will be supported under cash for training and humanitarian life-saving sector through direct cash paid by the finance department.

The projectwillsupport 70 PSN with safety nets through unconditional cash grant for a period of three months. The cash transfer value will be based on the MEB. The CTP Standard Operation Procedure for Cash grant will be followed. For example, selection criteria will beshared with OPM, UNHCR and the local leadership and this will be used to conduct selection of the beneficiaries, more importantly, the 1st tire selection criteria shall be used to identify the beneficiaries. The project will ensure risks are identified and taken care of prior to the cash transfer. Post distribution monitoring will be done to establish and assess value for money and feedback from the beneficiaries.

Restored earning capacities of selected HGRF I beneficiaries whose businesses were affected byCOVID-19  through cash for work modality for road rehabilitation.  The work will be done by 60 selected community members identified during transparent community dialogue meetings with the local leaders and other stakeholders. The CTP StandardOperating Procedures (SOPs) will be adhered to during the whole process.31 selected female beneficiaries will access business supplies to rejuvenate their businesses. The cash transfer value will be based on the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) . A PostDistributionMonitoring to check take off of the businesses and provision of ongoing business support shall be undertaken.

Undertake community access road rehabilitation through Cash for Work. A total of 4 km road (Yelulu-Kiridoaku) was selected because the road leads to food distribution point &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; market, and it is literally impassable. Using a clear selection criterion, the CfW will enable the participating households acquire cash to buy food and other basic household goods. The consortium will adopt the Mercy Corps&#x2019; Guidelines to Cash-for-Work Programming and the Oxfam CTP Standard Operating Procedures and steps for CfW will be followed by the Consortium.  The Cash value paid to beneficiaries will be determined by the general labour market survey conducted by theconsortium during inception meetings. The number of days worked shall be recorded on daily basis by the village supervisor. This record will further be verified by the Cash Programme supervisor and the finance staff. Once properly done, the financestaff will prepare payment sheets that will be approved by the project manager and later forwarded to the accredited SACCO to effect payments.  Cash will be distributed on site via the accredited SACCO. At least there will be 50:50 gender representation in CfW projects. Wage rates from the other agencies i.e. Cash Working Group will be applied . It is expected that each of the two villages (Yelulu and Kiridoaku) will have 30 selected persons and work for 20 days to accomplish the 4km road.

Basedon thestrong recommendation by OPM during needs assessment, the consortium will undertake distribution of 3,000 face masks to the most vulnerable refugee households in collaboration withOPM. The face masks will be produced by the vulnerable refugee andhost youth who were trained in tailoring and garments during the HRGF 1 and they have the capacity to produce standard masks.  The PALM Corps consortium will collaborate with the District Health Office, OPM and UNHCR for quality assurance. They will signagreements with the consortium. Using a clear selection criterion, the preselected 3,000 (1,500 male and 1,500 female) beneficiaries will access the face masks from the mask producers using the voucher system distributed prior to the distribution and strictly monitored by the project staff and CTP officer.

The Consortium partners will conduct feedback meetings for two months to keep key stakeholders such as target beneficiaries (refugee and host), Local authorities,OPM UNHCR and other agencies implementing CTP up to date. Additional in order to handle feedback and complaints a help desk will beset at PALM Corps field office desk at Siripi which is more accessible to the beneficiaries. A dedicated telephone will be communicated to groups on stickers shared with all beneficiaries.

Conduct post-distribution monitoring to determine how cash received wasused, amount received, preferences of cash vs. in-kind. The PDM will also help to verify that the households met the selection criteria initially and still qualify for the programme

Two Joint monitoring and field visits will be conducted to assess progress of implementation and also provide feedback to beneficiaries. The visit will involve district leadership both technical and political, OPM andsub county leadership. Targeted field visits to selected beneficiaries&#x2019; households, road rehabilitation sites to monitor progress. The reports will be shared in the relevant sector working group meetings monthly.

The Consortium partners will participate in sector working group meetings that include:  Cash Working Group meetings, COVID 19 response coordination meetings for Rhino camp settlement, Livelihood sector working group. Already the consortium partners have been incorporated into the COVID 19 response coordination meetings for Rhino camp settlement. These meeting will enable the consortium members to share updates, learning (good practices)and participate in decision-making process in the selected sectors.

Produce and distribute visibility materials for project staff and board of Consortium partners: Visibility is a very important tool in activity implementation. The consortium will produce shirtswith logos of Oxfam and that of the consortium partners and distribute to project staff and board membersfor visibility

On monthlybasis supervisory field visit will be conducted by EDs and M&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;E to assess implementation progress and beneficiary feedback to guide management decision. The supervision will be conducted before consortium coordination meetingsso that issues found in the field can be discussed during the coordination meetings.

The RTR Lite exercise will be conducted to assess the level of intervention after 6-8 weeks of implementation. The action plan from RTR Lite helped the other consortium membersto review strategies and targets in order to optimize results.</narrative>

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
The influx of refugees in West Nile has attracted a couple of humanitarian and development organizations who areproviding social services to the refugees and the host community to complement on government efforts. With the localization policy of the government of Uganda, this presents opportunities for local organizations to partner with the international organizations to participate in responding to the crisis and development challenges in the region. The demand for social services in huge especially in the refugee settlements where access to and quality of education, health services and food is a problem. WFP provides food or cash for refugees to buy food. The prices of food items increased as result of the influx and unfortunately the local population is not responding adequately to produce food to meet the demand. The region is still net importer of food itemsespecially vegetables, beans and maize from other regions of Uganda and DRC.  PALM has rich experience of value chain development and facilitation of multi-stakeholder processes which makes the organization attractive to several development actors.

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PICOT
The proposed intervention is designed to address the critical Livelihood and WASH needs of refuges and Host communities through enhancing alternative livelihood options, adopting positive copping strategies and WASH.
Through the proposed activities, beneficiaries&#x2019; livelihood options will be enhanced by creating more opportunity to engage on IGA activities thereby securing their livelihoods and reducing vulnerabilities due to income shocks and risks. Once the livelihood options are diversified, dependence on food ratios will be reduced and households&#x2019; disposable income will be boosted and beneficiaries will have positive coping strategies.

The Cash Transfer Program approach of the intervention will put money into beneficiary&#x2019;s packet and increase their dignity to spend on their most important needs as valued by them. CTP approach under this intervention is expected to boast the market systems by supporting other actors directly and indirectly along the chain.
The Goal of the Project is; To enhance livelihood and self-reliance of refugees and Host community through alternative livelihood strategies and promotion of hygiene and sanitation practices in Lobule refugee settlement by Dec. 2020.

The objectives of the project is;  To promote alternative livelihood options and positive copying strategies for refugees and Host communities through Cash Transfer Modality by December 2020. To promote good hygiene and sanitation practices among refugee and host communities in lobule settlement by Dec 2020 and To promote alternative livelihood options and positive copying strategies and promote good hygiene and sanitation practices. Hence it seeks to amalgamate Livelihood and WASH in efforts topromote self-reliance among the refugees and host communitieswhile fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic and community infection through WASH Practices.

To archive the proposed objectives the following activities will be conducted; PICOT and consortium members will work with OPM, UNHCR and other partners to identify and Support 250 Persons with special needs (PSNs) and extremely vulnerable individuals (EVIs) with multipurpose cash grant. The criteria for selection will be based on the PSN codes and multiple vulnerability (usingthe latest updated PSN List by UNHCR). The community will also be sensitized about the selection criteria and they will participatein validation of the selected beneficiaries to ensure that the most needy and vulnerable of the beneficiaries are supported.
The identified beneficiaries will be supported with financial support amounting to a total of 96,000 shillings paid one off (But meant to last for three months). The transfer value will attract a Transfer cost of 9% of transfer value. The Transfer value was determined using the March 2020 (updated in May) Minimum expenditure Basket (MEB) . The transfer value will contribute to Food (15,000), Hygiene(4,000), water (1,000), Health (1,000), HH items &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; personal expenditures (2,000) and Livelihood (10,000).

The mode of cash transfer will be byuse of a financial institution (preferably SACCOs because of a lower transfer fee) transferred either via mobile money  or direct cash with strict adherence to the Oxfam CTP SOP . The service provider will be identified following the PICOT Procurement andbidding procedure.

Post distribution monitoring will be conducted after each distribution cycle to assess the effectiveness and use of the cash grant by beneficiaries.
PICOT will use her Complaint and feedback mechanism throughout the project periodto enhance feedforward, feedback and accountability to all the beneficiaries and community at large. The community will also be made aware of the various channels of complaints and feedback so that they can channel their complains and addressed by the project team

While there is no sufficient land to engage all refugees in agricultural production as informed by our need assessment, PICOT recognizes that there are various potential and diverse skills among refugees and host communities that can be transformed into viable business opportunities. A total of 5 groups of youth and women will be targeted for IGAs. Each group will comprise 5 members each for easymanagement and group dynamics based on past learning. For this component, consortium partners willtarget those with the required skills, experience and motivation and who have the potential to succeed in the livelihood support activities.
PICOT will select 5 viable IGAs to be supported with startup support kits or grants. Youth, women and PSNs will be sensitized on various business options that can be supported including; establishing and operating grain milling machines, hand operating groundnut-paste making machine, Hand crafts, small grocery shops/kiosks, vegetable vending, salons and barber shops to mention but a few. The grants will be competitive and the best business plans that demonstrate sustainability rather than profitability will be selected for funding. The 5 best business ideas will receive start up grants in kind or Cash worth fromUGX1,000,000-3,500,000 each depending on the business idea and type a total 7,500,000 Ugx has been earmarked in the budget for the IGAs.

The Project will provide 1000 Tip taps and 1 bars of soap for each house hold in the refugee settlement and host community through use of commodity voucher.
PICOT in collaboration with SpiritFM and Lobule Women Group will Provide 1000 Tip taps and 1 bars of soap for households in the refugee settlement and host communityto boost hand washing at household level through use of commodity voucher during a trade fair organized within the settlement. It was noticed during our need assessment and observation from the previous intervention that majority of households (over 65%) lacked handwashing facilities. According tothe Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) population projection Statistics obtained from koboko district Planning unit and OPM office, Lobule refugee settlement and the Four refugee hosting parishes have a total 2,214 households (891 are refugees HHs). The 1000 tip-taps will contribute in closing the gap and increase coverage of hand washing facilities at HH by 45%.

The hygiene promoters and selected Youths &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; women will be trained on making tip-tap handwashing technology who will be engaged in making andinstalling of the Tip-Taps through a Cash for work modality. 40 youth, women and PSNs will be engaged to make 5 Tip Taps per day for 5days at 5000 per man day. A days training on how to make the tip taps will be conducted for the youth and the hygiene promotors who will also continue to monitor the usage of the Tip Taps. The installation process will be done in the presences of the beneficiaries so that they can learn how it is done which will be a sustainability strategy.This intervention is aimed at boostinghygiene at household level and prevents communicable diseases related to fecal and food contamination including COVID19. The Tip-taps will be branded with Partner Logos and COVID-19 Hand washing/Hygiene Messages as IEC materials.

PICOT in collaboration with Spirit FM and Lobule Women Group will work with water user committee members, community members and local authorities to protect the 19 community water points by engaging youths within to fence and greenish the water points through cash for work modality. Reference will be made to Oxfam&#x2019;s cash transfer programing SOP to effectively execute cash for work process. The Cash for work (CfW) activity will target unemployed youth and women informed by the labour market assessment reports and selection criteria with the objective of putting cash in the hands of the youth and women to improve household income. CfW activities will focus on water source protection, through establishing fences using local available materials, natural turf.
Engaging bothhostand refugee youth and women will assist in promoting social cohesion and peaceful co-existence between the communities.  Selection criteria will include beneficiaries with no employment opportunities; no production assets; no/limited support from kinshipin the settlement and members of high dependency families (more than 6 members).

The Cash for work value of 6,000 per day for two days per water point determined by the local labour cost for similar work will be used to execute this activity. A group of 5people will work at each of the water point.
Community members through the water user committees will be mobilized to cost share by contributing small amount of money as maintenance feefor future need. This intervention will enable ownership and protection of water sources thereby increasing their life spans. Communities can effectively prevent destructions caused by stray animals. The MEAL of PICOT together with consortium members will conductPost-Work Monitoring of Cash Usage and Work Quality when the work is completed.

PICOT in collaboration with Spirit FM and Lobule Women Group will hold 3 community radio dialogues/talk shows and community sensitization meetings to address poor community attitude and practices on hygiene and sanitation. These sensitizations will take the form of radio talk shows and community discussions in a group of 15 &#x2013; 30 led by hygiene promoters at village level. Content of the meetings will address general hygiene and sanitation practices at households, maintenance ofwater sources, gender issues, attitude change on hygiene and sanitation practices. An estimated number of 500 people is expected to be reached through community meetings and 3000 people through radio talk shows on hygiene and sanitation. Community radio dialogues will take the form of recording community voices on policy issues concerning hygiene and sanitation that directly affect the health of refugees, host communities and undermine local initiatives. Issues raised will be addressed during talk shows that will feature responsible duty bearers. Through the dialogue and 3 specific issues are either addressed instantly or ear marked for address in the next planning circle.
Radio Spot massages will also be run Trice a day for three months in 3 different language of Kakwa, Lugbara and English on WASH, COVID-19 and to give more light on the project activities.
CROSS CUTTING ACTIVITIES

PICOT in collaboration with Spirit FM and Lobule Women Group will organize an inception meeting involving OPM, implementing partners at the settlement, local government leadership (district and sub county) and refugee leadership. This meeting will mark the entry point for the intervention and detail the project, its objectives, activities, expected out puts and the approved budget. It will also be used to rally leaders and other IP behind the project for its success.

PICOT a consortium member will work within the exiting guidelines to conduct a rapid needs assessment to ascertain the rightful beneficiaries in the settlement, market analysis, status of water sources and households without proper handwashing facilities in refugee and host communities in lobule Sub County.
Theassessment will provide baseline information and validate the available information.

PICOT in collaboration with Spirit FM and Lobule Women Group will conduct post distribution monitoring and Post-Work  Monitoring of Cash Usage and Work Quality to determine beneficiary certification, get feedback on the activities, document success and address immediate challenges. Through PDM we hope to identify unmet needs of refugees and other emerging issues to inform our delivery mechanism.

PICOT together with Spirit FM and Lobule Women Group will attend partner coordination meetings to update partners on thestatus of implementation, feedback and share experience. Through these meetings, we fore see strong partnership ties with OPM and other Implementing partners that meaningfully benefit consortia members.

PICOT in collaboration with Spirit FM and LobuleWomen Group will hold internal planning meetings to discuss implementation progress, activity plans and address emerging implementation issues to ensure the team stay focused to the expected deliverables.

PICOT in collaboration with Spirit FM andLobule Women Group will document project result both in audio, video and pictorialformats to show case the intervention achievements, challenges and lessons learnt and share with stakeholders and donors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Partners In Community Transformation (PICOT) is non-profit making Organization founded in 2005 by a group of progressive youth graduates as a CBO in the names of Koboko Youth In Development (KOYID).  The overall goal then was to address development challenges in health (HIV/AIDS) education and lack of skills among youths, women and other vulnerable communities in Koboko District specifically.Due to growth in capacity and programming, in 2013, the organization was registered with National NGO board as PICOT and licensed to work in west nile region. At this point strategic decisions were made to review the vision, mission and strategic objective, expand geographical coverage and thematic focus to include humanitarian response given PICOT#s geographical location along the border of three countries (Uganda, DR Congo and South Sudan). This strategic transformation witnessed changes in organizations# policies. PICOT embarked on a rigorous process of policy review and development. Most notably is the gender policy, work place HIV policy, safe guarding policy and the minimum humanitarian standards guidelines. It was also at this point that PICOT got its first female executivedirector. PICOT continues to pay special attention to gender integration in its institutional growth and program design and implementation to realize its overall vision of holistically transformed communities.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?
Over last three years, PICOT has registered tremendous success in its major thematic areas. This can be summarized as follows
1. Health programming
0ver 6,367 people have been reached through our community programs, stakeholder meetings and digital media platforms in West Nile region. 2,830 of total population reached are females of different social characteristics.  This has increased youth access to SRHR services and information at community, school and facility levels. The graph below gives more details of the number people reached by category excluding social and electronic media.
Successfully advocated for local governments, schools and health units to allocate budget for youth friendly services, as result schools recruited senior teachers, budget for girl child was improved, special capacity building for senior women and men teachers on managing adolescent were conducted, youth friendly corners were established in two health units to provide reproductive healthservices to youths.

PICOT engaged over 2,526 youths of which 1,421 were females in and out of school in direct conversations on sexual reproductive health risks and prevention through forum theatre plays, Twogere (let&apos;s talk)## game, games and sports and outreaches to increase awareness on SRHR risks among young people, increase demand for reproductive health services and encourage parental involvement in SRH discussion with children at household levels. This has improved responsiveness, changed perceptions and assumptions regarding SRH information among youths, parents and community gate keepers.

HIV Programming
159 clients with suppressed viral load
189 clients resumed care from the lost to follow list of
21 TB contacts traced were found positive and are started on treatment.
A total of 3290 people were referred for services from communities to different service points.
Index testing services generated 18 positives tests of which were 7 females and 11 males.
Governance and accountability
Within our project of social accountability implemented in Koboko and Maracha districts, PICOT engaged communities to donate land for putting up twin staff house for dranya health center staffs. In Wadra health center III maracha district, communities were mobilized to construct kitchen for the inpatient department. The coolest about this is how each community donated resources to have the kitchen constructed with now helping mothers in theward. A total 704 people reached of which 409 males and 295 females
Youth Skilling Project
PICOT skilled 1,500 youths of which 749 females and 751males in different non formal skills areas such as tailoring, carpentry and joinery, metal fabrications, netting, saloon and hair dressing, motorcycle mechanics among others  to empower the youths and boost their livelihood opportunities.

4. Humanitarian Response
5. Organizational capacity Building
Geographical areas:
By mandate PICOT is licensed to work in West Nile region however currently PICOT operates in four districts of Maracha, Koboko Yumbe and Arua.
4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? &apos;In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?
PICOT as an organization emerged from the very social, political and economic challenges vulnerable communities face on daily basis however these challenges have continued to affect lives of vulnerable people at different lengths and period often caused by social, economic and political factors and because of community#s vulnerabilities, they have not responded well to the shocks brought about by such eventualities hence their livelihood and social wellbeing is ever threatened.PICOT positions its self to mobilize local communities, empower and support them as chage agents to spear head and address their own challenges in the 9 districts (Koboko, Arua, Yumbe, Adjumani, Zombo, Pakwach, Moyo, Nebbi and Maracha) of West Nile sub region, with the aim of not just providing services, but more importantly setting out to influence the sector of health, WASH, agriculture and education to be responsive tothe local needs.
Our five year strategic themes attest to our commitment to effectively deliver through our core functions of improved health services, education and skills development, improving Livelihood and environment and responding to humanitarian needs of the refugees and host communities.
Together with its partners PICOT will respond to the West Nile regions# sector challenges in Health, Education, Humanitarian response, Livelihoods and environment, by addressing issues of inequality in access, weak sustainabilitymechanisms, low investment in the selected sectors and governance concerns by strengthening transparency and accountability. As such, in the next five years PICOT will position itself as an advocate and direct service provider to work with the most vulnerable of communities which include Children in and out of school,Women, Persons with Disability, People Living with HIV/Aids, Internally Displaced People and refugees, and the elderly. Specifically, PICOT will focus on pathways that lead to improved interventions, give equal opportunities for women and men and ensurecommunities have equal access to service provision in West Nile region.
PICOT will continue working with meaningful partners with common values and principles at various levels among which include local NGOs, networks, governments, donors, private sector,academic and research institutions in a bid to achieve its vision. As an indigenous organization, PICOT has the potential and comparative advantage of mobilizing the communities to participate in their development process. The organization has the community trust and support with existing structures and a network volunteers who share the organizations# vision.

Beneficiary selection and verification of extremely vulnerable households / persons with special needs. This will be done with UNHCR/OPM/LWF/RWCs for PSN lists and verification.  Cash for work modality support to PSN in land opening and kitchen gardens. Will be done through the Kitgum SACCO. Agricultural input support &#x2013; farm seeds &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; tools through cash (value) Voucher / Coupon andtechnical agricultural extension service support. Emphasis will be working with the Private Business Sector appraised by SORUDA to provide in puts through Voucher / Coupon.
Procure through Service Provider and distribute (in-kind) hand washing tip-taps, soaps andwater purification supplies to the refugees and host-communities. Critical is in adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

Through Cash Transfer modality, SORUDA and FOKAPOWA proposes to implement an integrated Food Security and Vulnerable Livelihood intervention that are mindful of environmental considerations, WASH and mainstreams gender and protection issues. It will be complemented by ongoing USAID Uganda Sanitation and Health Activity (USHA) and policy influencing with the appropriate authorities on the basisof issues raised in the course of the humanitarian response. Helping households meet basic food needs and rights enhances survival and choice to live a dignified life. This CCT project will promote food security and livelihood interventions through cash-based transfer modality that is in line with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure some food and income are obtained by vulnerable refugee and host-communities especially youth, women and men. Addressing food security needs and influencing for refugees and host-communities is buttressed by the fact that very few options are available for refugee households as well as host-community members to eke a living within the poor economic and livelihood setting they are in. This integrated approach is important because food security and livelihood outcomes cannot be achieved without an enabling environment; and agricultural dependent livelihoods cannot be sustainable without the management of the natural resources

WASH Intervention: Be aligned to the MoH SOP guidelines and Presidential directives on influencing behavioral practices in hand-washing with soap or sanitizers, wearing masks and social distancing to eliminate COVID-19, Germs, bacteria and water borne diseases. The key priority will ensure creating awareness on safe water chain and hand-washing with soap as well as proper waste disposal, fecal containment and sustaining positive hygiene practices. Overall, issues of public health and COVID-19, institutes personal and respiratory hygiene practices that curtail the virus spread. Limiting often isthe problem of hand washing withsoap, access to PPEs for staff that CCT Project will address by directly procuring and distributing(agreed package) at household levels. Service Providers appraised by SORUDA will provide the items worth the value for payment. TheCOVID-19 response, willbe done through WASH sector coordination together with Lamwo District Task Force and its decentralized sub-structures at Sub-county and Parish levels. The Consortium being members will contribute to quality improvements in service delivery by sharing progress and feedback from the communities being supported with all stakeholder, District COVID-19 Task Force, UNHCR and OPM.

Gender and Protection: Given that the large majority of refugees are women and children; the CCT Project focuses their inclusiontoensure their specific protections needs are addressed while observing the humanitarian response principles. These issues include: 1) the burden on women and girls as providers for their families in an unfamiliar environment, often without the social support ofextended family and friends (Situation analysis vis-a-vis gender issues is elaborated). 2) exposure of women and young girls to harm including sexual and gender-based violence in a bid to feed for themselves and their families; 3) the ability ofwomen to access information about basic services, food rights and make decisions about issues affecting them. This Project will deliberately work withwomen, girls and youth in addressing their food and WASH needs that are preventing refugees and host communities from enjoying their right to a decent livelihood including obtaining food and income and to support appropriate programming to encourage peaceful co-existence. Refugee men and women use resources differently. To be effective, strategies to improve food security using cash-based transfer empowers them to make choices and decisions for their households. Therefore, the Project will pay close attention to the impact of disparities between women and men access to resources and opportunities. This implieswomen and men will be allies in formulating and pursuing strategies for more equitable development but more in addressing their needs. The integration of the GAL approach in the implementation also recognizes that refugee women and men have differenttypes of vulnerabilities, strategies and responsibilities in environmental change and impact mitigation. There is, therefore, a need to integrate gender issues in food insecure, environmental vulnerability and risk analysis in COVID-19 context.

SORUDAand FOKAPAWA - CCT Project interventions respond to the needs of both refugee and host communities &#x2013; at a 70:30 ratio as per the guidelines of Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) / UNHCR to improve:
&#x2022; Co-existence between the host and refugee communitieswill diffuse potential tensions on land related conflicts and benefits associated with the project.
&#x2022; Cash transfer modality activities will support especially the women and able youth selected by PSN householdswith income to be able to access food, address WASH and engaging also in small scale agriculture activities.
&#x2022; By avoiding going tosearch for food and WASH for households, it will ensure protection of women from risks of rights abuse (esp. Sexual and gender-based violence) and sanitation related disease outbreaks.
&#x2022; The Consortium will work with all stakeholders (Local Government, Refugee Welfare Committees, OPM, UNHCR, Oxfam and other partners) to ensure gender analysis is used in influencing policies and programmes that affect refugees and host communities.
&#x2022; Activities that promote energy conservation will support both gender, save time used for looking for firewood and building materials
&#x2022; The Consortium is cognizant of the current fact that 86% are women and children together, 3% elderly, 44%Male, 56% Female, and 58% are children &lt;(&gt;&lt;&lt;)&gt;18 years of age when targeting

The CCT Project will carry out cash transfer modality for the Persons with Special Needs (PSN) households through community projects such as supporting vulnerable householdsto initiate agriculture with agri-inputs e.g. seeds &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; tools. The households will be provided with vegetable &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; seedlings which will enhance their nutrition intake through horticultural production as well as work positively towards environment protection.

The Project will use cash transfer modality entirely in supporting Persons with Special Needs (PSN) households by contracting Service Provider to supply COVID-19 related items. Appraised Private Service Provider will provide items such as soap, tip-taps etc. to be distributed to the households. Each household will be provided with a package for prevention of COVID-19.

Project Goal: To contribute to socio-economic protection and empowerment of disadvantaged women, men and children in North Karamoja (Kotido, Kaabong and Karenga).
Specific Objective 1: Enhance socio-economic empowerment of vulnerable women, menand Children (GBV survivors) using cash transferCaritas Kotido Diocese, Manna Development Agency (MADA) and Nakere Rural

Women Activists (NARWOA) will map out 360 vulnerable individuals, verify and assess the needs based on the areas of operation (Kaabong, Karenga and Kotido) respectively. Mapping, assessment, selection and Verification tool that will be developed by the three partners and done jointly with the District officials,

Consortia members will support the process of sourcing a cash transfer service provider; Mobilize the beneficiaries and distribution of the cash to beneficiaries in the different areas of operation. The 360 beneficiaries will be supported with through the Mobile Money transfer amounting to UGX: 102,000/=. Per month Which is according to the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) updated guidance for Cash Working Group- May, 2020. The items to be considered as per updated minimum expenditure basket for cash working group included; Food, Hygiene, Water, Energy (cooking and lighting), Transport, Communication, Clothing, Health Household items and personal expenditure, Livelihoods. The items listed above informed the amount to be transferred to the beneficiaries. (MEB updated on 12 May 2020).

The project intends to use cash transfer modality in delivering the response that provides an opportunity to the affected people to make greater choices and dignity for empowerment in decision making to promote local markets. (Oxfam in Uganda SOPs on cash transfer). The delivery mechanism which is appropriate at the moment is through mobile money transfer to the beneficiaries. However much of the finance and programme roles during the cash transfer will be undertaken according the Oxfam in Uganda Standard Operating Procedures of cash transfer programme implementation. The MEB Rates as at May are still relative and can still be used to determine the transfer value especially food items like Bean(kg),maize(kg),cooking oil(litre), salt(gms) have not changes so much and this has been the basis for the determination of the Transfer Value to the beneficiaries as indicated in

Consortia members will support the post-distribution monitoring with the different stakeholders (district officials), to determine the effectiveness of the intervention andhow it is promoting livelihood enhancement.

The consortia members will support the process of project evaluation and conduct exit meetings.
Kaabong (Loyoro and Lodiko),Karenga(Lokori,kawalakol),Kotido(Nakapelimoru,panyangara).The mapping, assessmentwill help in identification of beneficiaries. The selection and verification of the Beneficiaries to avoid biases,conflict of interest and duplication/double targeting of beneficiaries.The cash transferred will improve the household income levels and increased purchasing power, savings among others.The Cash transfer will be done through the Beyonic platform using the telecommunication networks such as MTN Uganda and Airtel Uganda depending on the contact number provided by the beneficiaries.The beneficiaries have identified the Mobile money as a good method of receiving support and this has been used also during the response to COVID-19.

Gender considerations: The project will factor in a protection lens where the right and left lenses will all focusonthe pertinent issues affecting women and men. Vulnerability assessment tool is very important is this undertaking. It is proven that women andchildren are always the most vulnerable in any emergency situation. Therefore, it&#x2019;s imperative that the projectsupport will be biased towards vulnerable women and children who are worst hit by the impacts of the humanitarian crisis. We shall also target extremelyvulnerable men.

Age: Elderly and children are highly vulnerable during any humanitarian crisis.Theproject will target child headedhouseholds, Extremely Vulnerable women and men. The child protection policy will also guide the engagement of the children in the project and the Core Humanitarian standards. The child headed will benefit from the intervention while considering the Do No Harm principle relating to children and other beneficiaries.
Conflict sensitivity and diversity: In conflict sensitivity the project will behinged on the principle of &#x201C;do no harm&#x201D; as per the sphere standards and theinternational Red cross code of conduct. Keen/critical consideration will be employed to ensure that the intervention does not trigger/escalate occurrences of GBV in the communities so as to benefit from the project. An assessment will be done per proposed beneficiary to ascertain the cause of the violence. (protectionCase management practices)

 The project will support all the vulnerable persons irrespective of tribe, ethnicity, sexual orientation, color, creed for as long as they are within the project areaand targeted. The complaints handling and feedback mechanisms processes will be enforced as per the consortium partner policies. The different partners&#x2019; Prevention of Exploitation and sexual Harassment (PESH) will be one of the vital legal documents thatthe project team will use to guide the project intervention/activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">#According to Associated Press June 2017, Over 10,500 children arrived with strangers or relatives as they flee conflict from SouthSudan in 2016 that are not their parents and live in the Bidibidi and Imvepi refugee settlements in northern Uganda, according to World Vision, which has put more than 3,000 of them into foster care. The rest have been reunited with family, Talagwa said.
The children, referred to as unaccompanied minors, pose serious challenges for aid workers who quickly have to figure outwhat to do with them when they cross the border. Even when the children show maturity far beyond their years, they still need the care of foster parents who are vetted on many grounds, including a clear sense of kinship.#

It is upon the above report/article that we were motivated, inspired and touched to start I CAN South Sudan so as to engage the unaccompanied children in social and musical activities to heal them of trauma.
Created by refugee youth, Stephen Wandu Bimo (founder), Seme Ludanga Faustino (cofounder) and a Ugandan, Kyobutungi Angela (cofounder) in October 2017, I CAN South Sudan initially selected 20 unaccompanied refugee children in Bidibidi Refugee Settlement Zone 1 with the help of the community and started its activities at Chrisco Church, in May 2018, I CAN South Sudan received a Good Will support of Euro 5,000 from Misereor Germany to help the 20 children over 6 months. This support helped I CAN South Sudan to record a music album and shot one video for the unaccompanied children,giving them voice to express their desire for peace, unity,forgiveness, reconciliation and coexistence among South Sudanese. The children were also taken out to Zoo and beach in Entebbe and Freedom City. The children were periodically provided with scholastic materials, body lotion and soap

In 2019, the organization hasgrown from 3 founding members to 14 members that includes 5 ladies most of whom are in strategic positions. Above 50 children come for the I CAN practices and activities.
The organization has been registered both in South Sudan and Uganda and we have launched Artand drawing program in Rockland Primary school in Bidibidi Zone 1 that engage 40 children in art and drawing program and planting of fruits and distribute them to the households freely as a seed of peace.
In 2014, Yumbe district#s recorded population numbered roughly 485,000 Ugandans. Yumbe is the historic land of the Aringa people, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers and followers of Islam. Yumbe is one of the poorest districts in Uganda. Schools and health centres are severely under-resourced and underperforming, infrastructure is underdeveloped, and economic opportunities lag behind the rest of the nation. The Aringa#s history of conflict,poverty, and Islamic faith provide a backdrop of perceived and actual marginalization of the Aringa inside Uganda. Unlike other communities in northern Uganda, the Aringa do not report sharing direct ethnic ties to communities across the border in South Sudan; however, many Aringa are aware of distant kinship with many groups of South Sudan. The Aringa language is part of the Central Sudanic family, which also includes South Sudan&apos;s Ma#di, Avokaya and Moro languages. Aringa is distinct but related to the Lugbara spoken inArua. Aringa is variously categorized as a dialect of Lugbara or as a separate language of its own. Many Aringa speak both Aringa and common Lugbara. There are no known indigenous Aringa populations in South Sudan. However, some Aringa feel an affiliation with their South Sudanese neighbours as marginalized groups with shared historical and kinship links.


Relations between the host community and refugees are good due to the shared historical ties. Refugees and nationals are occasionally brought together for dialogues onpressing issues informing the response, which has also improved the delivery of services.

Bidi Bidi settlement was established in September 2016 to host the rapid influx of South Sudanese refugees, primarily arriving from the Equatoriaregion. The settlement population increased rapidly to over 280,000 people, making it one of the largest refugee settlements in the world. As of December 2016,Bidi Bidi reached maximum capacity and stopped accepting new arrivals.

According to RefugeeInformation Management System (RIMS) June 2018, The following are the gaps and challenges in Bidi Bidi Zone 1 and among the gaps and challenges, Child protection was reported as a significant gap in Bidi Bidi settlement. 96% of children PSNs need to be provided with individual case management, 21% of unaccompanied or separated children have not been provided with interim or long term care and 7% of cases in the past three months ofchild abuse or exploitation received age and gender services

There areonlyfew clean water sources available to the population in Bidi Bidi. Long distance to the water points, long waiting lines and high congestion are issues facing refugees collecting water. Thefew existing boreholes are of poor quality, nationals reported repairs of the boreholes are continuously delayed. The water supplied is insufficient, which is exacerbated by the dry season. As sources dry up, both refugees and nationals are forced to collect water from unprotected water sources. Furthermore, the poor latrine coverage in the settlement has led to increased open defecation, which further deteriorates the hygiene and sanitation in Bidi Bidi.
Access to quality education is limited for both refugees and the surrounding host community. Schools are few with insufficient classrooms and insufficient teachers leading to low teacher per student ratios. This was reported to severely inhibit the students# learning environment. This is further deteriorated by the lack of schoolmaterials and lack of training for teachers. Moreover, the absence of vocational training institutions limits the opportunities available for students unable to access secondary school or those unable to access tertiary education. This significantly reduces theirchances to access livelihoodsopportunities in the future.
Refugees were provided with non-food items (NFIs), such as saucepans, solar lamps, mattresses and jerry cans, upon arrival to the settlement. These have, however not been re-distributed since the refugees&apos;arrival, which therefore means they are for the most part worn out or broken. This forces refugees to share with their neighbors and take it in turns to cook. The lack of access to functional NFIs reduces the living standards of refugees.
Both refugees and nationalsface important challenges in accessing livelihoods opportunities. Refugees, in particular, struggle to access land for agricultural activities. The land provided to them upon arrival is insufficient to cultivate crops and the cost of hiring land is expensive. Moreover, those that do have access to land struggle to harvest their crops as the land is infertile and they have not received improved seeds adapted to the harsh climate conditions. Nationals highlighted they also struggle to access livelihoods trainingopportunities preventing them from acquiring the skills needed for employment.
Child protection was reported as a significant gap in Bidi Bidisettlement. Refugee#s highlighted child-headed households are not provided with the appropriate servicesthey need. Moreover, children, particularly young girls, are often sent to collect firewood for their families far from the settlement, which has led to cases of rape and sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). Additionally, theft was reported to be an issue in the settlement where food items are often stolen at night.

Hence this is why we find our social services important in individual case management of the children, to provide interim and long term therapy care and advocate for children#s rights.</narrative>

The environment Community Empowerment for Creative Innovation (CECI) works in is diverse in cultures and ethnicity and is also characterised with some form of fear, ethnic divisions and violent conflicts, intolerance among others, besides being thickly populated by youth who, most suffered adversely armed conflicts, are traumatized,hopeless and idle.

Apart from government and business, other relevant social actors include church, associations/groups, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and institutions. These play roles that range from maintaining law and order, providing relief and humanitarian assistance, educational support, psychosocial and health care to social advocacy.

As the culture of CECI is to work always with the community and other relevant social actors such as earlier identified is in position to influence great positive change, inconsiderate of the closeness of the CECI to the community and the speaking of a common language used by the very diversecommunities we#re committed to serve as well as the diversity of the CECI team and its good relationship with the community, church, CBO/CSOs, and its better understanding of how the community feels.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action for People in Need Organization(APINO) and DANIDA Strategic Partnership project will promote positive social change among South Sudanese refugees and host communities in Uganda and back in South Sudan. Peace building is a core agenda because without it society cannot be productive. Many South Sudanese were traumatized because of the conflicts that negatively affected them in various ways ranging from losing their livelihood as well their beloved one who got killed or died on the way from South Sudan as they try to find safety in the neighbouring Country Uganda.

From single and informalinitiative, Lupai Music Foundation was transformed in  to community based organization now known as APINO, it has incorporated Men and Women, Girls and Boys who now own APINO.To balance gender, APINO focused more on women more especially on our livelihood component and education.

The peace building is particularly well-suited to undertaking advocacy because it is comprised of multiple organizations and individualswho can speak with one voice on a particular issue. A collective voice is often much stronger than a solitary voice, and speaking out collectively avoids backlash being directed at a lone individual or organization, especially when an issue is controversial or difficult. The media network will be used to help in conveying accurate information on Covid-19, peace issues, expose injustice, promote accountability, and generate dialogues, increase trust and confidence among the refugees, fulfill donor#s obligation, make APINO as an organization visible, educate the local community about available gender based violence services, communicate advocacy messages and raise awareness about issues and problems in the communities in which we work and the media also Say things we cannot.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Covid-19 door to door Campaigns will be used to create awareness and training on peace building and conflicts management will strongly equip the refugees with knowledge on the issues mentioned. Besides the campaigns, are dialogues involving recorded drama programwhich can be played on radio to educate the communities with regards to Covid-19 and Peace Building, trainings will be held in the seven villages of Ofua Zone. All selected locations for these dialogues will be carefully chosen based on the proposal guideline. These interactions will be documented, recorded and played in other parts of the country through radio stations/media outlets.
APINO will work in collaboration with the aforementioned community structures to undertaken follow up action plans, recommendation and promoting peace among the refugees various refugee settlements in Uganda.  APINO will train the religious leaders through the establishment of religious networks from the project sites to ensure that the messages are standardized, effective and clear. The trained members will use the key messages to carry out awareness and sensitization on Covid -19 and Peace Building and conflict management.
The peace building is particularly well-suited to undertaking advocacy because it is comprised of multiple organizations and individualswho can speak with one voice on a particular issue. A collective voice is often much stronger than a solitary voice, and speaking out collectively avoids backlash being directed at a lone individual or organization, especially when an issue is controversial or difficult. The media network will be used to help in conveying accurate information on Covid-19, peace issues, expose injustice, promote accountability, and generate dialogues, increase trust and confidence among the refugees, fulfill donor#s obligation, make APINO as an organization visible, educate the local community about available gender based violence services, communicate advocacy messages and raise awareness about issues and problems in the communities in which we work and the media also Say things we cannot. The Media Network established with the support of APINO as this will engage them in airing of jingles on radio stations and playing recorded drama in the mentioned project sites. The APINOwill also work with local leaders, youths, men and various women Groups included inawareness and sensitization on Covid-19 through recorded drama, forums, focus groups discussions, Jingles and Workshops.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. HISTORY:
          Community Action for Transformation or CAFOT is started in August of 2017 desired to engage the refugees youth in particular and the host community in comprehensive peace building, Hygiene and sanitation promotion and advocating for a quality education as a mean of building resilience and health living among the south Sudanese and host communities. The organization was started by a group of young people with the vision; to create a safe and peaceful atmosphere for human race including his God-given plan, domestic and wild- life and to deliver socio-economic development. So far the organization has improved since its formation andit also has taken gender mainstreaming as co in achieving its vision through programming, planning, andimplementation.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS:
       So far there is a resilient building among the refugee and the host community through the public forums that CAFOT already carried on since the beginning of 2018.
There is trust building among the young people, youth are already getting into groups to start up small business as a means to fight poverty and building a stronger relationship
Through our established school, the children are progressively moving in a right direction to face the future, this is meantto ensure illiteracy in removed completely in our society.
3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE:
Mission:  To see a reduced rate of the prevailing trauma, conflict and to build a health livingamong the refugees and host communities by provision of education, creation of awareness on hygiene and sanitation through participatory drama (forum theatre) and music.
  a. Institutional objectives:
1. To Open Adult literacy classes, Nursery and lower primary classes
2. To empower the rural women by providing trainingson basic business entrepreneurship skills, and creation of income generating activities
3. To create a flat form for communities to interact on societal issues that affect their living and adopt on the dynamics of the modern change as relates to positive resilience in community development.
4. To promote Hygiene and sanitation, as wellas unity, equality with gender sensitivity, justice and everlasting peace in the community through advocacy and other measures where necessary
5. To create awareness oncorruption, gender-based violence, promote leadership and good governance
6. To promote social understanding among, youth, women, elderly, children and families as a whole, through creation of forum theatre, debates and dialogue this gives them an opportunity to share their own experiences
7. To build the capacities of organized youth groups, drama groups, women associations, RWCs, religious leaders, Boda Boda associations, Taxi Drivers and brokers association, Market management committee, football clubs, local artists, water management committees, Hygiene promoters, Village girl child education promoters (VGCEP) among others through networking meetings and trainings to increase awareness to the grass root

   a). Field(s) of activity:
         1. Education: We use Physical education which is an integral part of educational program design to promote the optimum development of an individual physically, socially, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually through total body movement in the performance of properly selected physical activities. It is a process by which changes in the individual are brought about through movement#s experiences and it aims not only at physical development but is also concerned with education of the whole person through physical activities.
       2. Hygiene and sanitation: Sanitation refers to public health conditions related to clean drinking water and adequate treatment and disposal of human excreta and sewage. Preventing human contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal#oral route. For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stuntedgrowth in children, can be reduced through sanitation. There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low levels of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, trachoma, to name just a few
      3. Peace building awareness programs: Peacebuilding is an activity that aims to resolve injustice in nonviolent ways and to transform the cultural &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; structural conditions that generate deadly or destructive conflict. It revolves around developing constructive personal, group, and political relationships across ethnic, religious, class, national, and racial boundaries. This process includes violence prevention; conflict management, resolution, or transformation; and post-conflict reconciliation or trauma healing, i.e., before, during and after war.
We are currently in Imvepi refugee settlement, but with a plan to reach Rhino and Bidibidi settlements
Who are the social actors that benefit from the work? We target youth, (men, women, girls and boys)
4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING:
       We work directly with the office of the prime minster who is a principle representative of the government on ground, the church leaders, and local chiefs andalready established associations including the line ministries. These actors are supporters of our programs and they act like technical advisors in the day today running of community activities.
5. FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATIONAL CHART
       In the current board of director, out of seven members, the three are female. We have the Director who is a male and the program manager, while the position of the finance is a female , While the community mobilisers are a mixture of both male and female altogether.
6.CURRENT BALANCE SHEET/FINANCIAL POSITION
       We have not yet received much funding as a newly established organization apart from being funded on activities basis. This means we always relay on the contribution of our members and the volunteers.</narrative>

Perceptions and beliefs within the community can support or hinder a response, so it is important to understand and address them. Social norms, such as shaking hands, must be modified to prevent transmission of the disease. Disease prevention and treatment must be targeted to each community. Communication and information sharing about OVID-19 will be directed to using local languages, and information will be in various formats to address barriers to information related to literacy, language and disability.
Women, older people, children, people with disabilities, resettled people, and people with HIV/AIDS experience high vulnerabilities within a community and become even more vulnerable in emergency situations such as cyclone idai and now associated with covid-19 with the province of Sofala having registered 8 positive cases.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam has substantial experience in working and supporting WASH and agricultural programmes both globally and in the Gaza Strip, taking an approach that works with local communities, private sector providers, farmers, municipalities and local authorities. Oxfam will work with its partners PEF  and YEC to ensure they have access to  systems and procedures and standards are in place to achieve effective, high quality delivery. Oxfams particular added value in this action will be in its ability to bring together multiple stakeholders, local authorities, end users, the private sector, and public utilities, to enable the development of an equitable and appropriate to governance and accountability framework for the delivery of drinking water management services for the people of the Gaza Strip.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam Novib has been active in the Occupied Palestinian Territory/Israel (OPT/I) since 1982 and working with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since the mid 1980s. It has built up a strong network of relationships with local NGOs and counts among its localcounterparts some of the largest and most professional NGOs in various sectors. It has accompanied these NGOs in their development from ad hoc volunteer groups to sizeable professional institutions with national outreach.  At the same time the conceptualisation of the programme has evolved from three country programs in the early 1990s to a program for Palestinians in the Middle East (PME) working withPalestinians in OPT, Israel and Lebanon.

The programme has changed over the years with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the mid-1990s from a focus on support and service provision at a grassroots level and grassroots mobilization, to working towards influencing the establishment of the PA, its lawmaking and supporting building a democratic state # this involved supporting efforts of Palestinian civil society to build the basis for a democratic Palestinian state with room for civil participation, ensuring inclusion of vulnerable groups, refugees and women, and shaping its laws and systems. Oxfam Novib has also supported partners that are working on the provision of humanitarian assistance, response preparedness and conflict transformation. We have also supported partners in the provision of health services, access to quality education and gender justice.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to our previous successful Let&#x2019;s Speak Up program in Jakarta, hence the project needs to be scaled up. So, more YwDSs could speak up and step forward to become self-advocate and make progress in joining advocacy in the cross-disability movement and ensuring that there is no one left behind. The program needs to be scaled up in many more places besides Jakarta, thus YwDSs from another partof the city or regions has the same opportunity to speak up and be empowered as YwDSs who live in a more fortunate place to truly achieve dignity and equity of opportunity.

We would also need to train more human resources by doing internal and external capacity building. For our organization, we will train and educate more human resources for our staff candidate to become a coach and our existing self-advocate to become peer-buddies or class assistants. Our internal capacity building will strengthen their skill and ability to help us in conducting the program. Furthermore, we will implement external capacity building such as training for the teachers, trainers, support person, and parent who live in Jakarta and outside Jakarta.

We are aware of the uncertainty, situation, and condition due to COVID-19 whereas YwDSs are one group that fall to a high-risk group to catch virus include Coronavirus due to their comorbid condition. And that up-to-date Indonesia is still on its first stage, even more the new cases of positive Covid-19 are on therises or getting worse each day.  Yet, we are still eager to do the scale-up project and we have decided to conduct an online classas the best option to do so we could scale up the project with different communities but as well from other provinces. By doing theintervention online we could then reach out more participants from places around Indonesia.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IWRAW AP proposes to partner with AIPP, APNSW, APRRN, APTN, APWWDU represented by STEP, ASC, IDPC Asia and ILGA Asia (ILGA will notreceive financial support, but will contribute network resource and professional support) - eight networks and organisations in Asia advocating for the rights of women facing multiple forms of discrimination. The joint project will aim at strengthening intersectional movement building in Asia as the key to developing transformative advocacy strategies that center the voices and lived experiences of diverse groups of marginalised women and challenge multiple systems of oppression to achieve systemic gender equality. Targetcountries for this project will be Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, India and Pakistan, with regional and global spheres of impact. We have updated our focus countries to include Cambodia and Pakistan and to exclude Nepal and Thailand, as multiple consortiumpartners have strong national partnerships in Cambodia and Pakistan and interest from country partners to engage in this project. Additionally, we sought to prioritise Voice focus countries in the final selection. The project addresses the Voice impact theme: space for political participation and citizen engagement. Over the 33-month period, the project partners will organise online and offline activities to: build our collective capacities on intersectionality theory and practice; understand how to engage in CEDAW advocacy and activism from an intersectional perspective;facilitate capacity building and intersectional movement building among national partners in all five target countries; reflect on our experiences of seeking to apply intersectionality in advocacy and movement building, and document these practices; engage in strategising and advocacy planning to offer a collective and systems response to specific manifestations of gender equality;develop an intersectional feminist, cross-movement advocacy roadmap, addressing issues such as bodily rights, health rights, migrant rights, digital rights,decriminalisation and decarceration; network and build cross-movementsolidarity at regional level;support national partners to put into practice collective, intersectional advocacy, research or campaign actions; and create and share knowledge with ourmovements on practical ways to apply intersectionality in advocacy, movement building and organisational practices, through creative communications. The specific results we will deliver include: Strengthened collective understanding of intersectionality and intersectional feminism among nine key networks and organisations working to eradicate gender inequality in Asia Regional and national cross-movement roadmaps for joint advocacy outlining intersectional entry points forcollective action towards eliminating gender inequality Documented good practices and strategies for applying an intersectional approach to eliminating gender inequality in Asia Due to COVID-19 and related restrictions, activities taking place over the first 18 months will be organisedvirtually. We will strengthen our own capacities to organise online by undergoing training on digital advocacy, and digital and holistic security during the inception phase. In order to overcome challenges to wellbeing and inter-personal connection posedbyprolonged COVID-19 measures, we will organise quarterly wellness sessions involving activities such as meditation, online workouts, group discussions, etc. Seeking to ensure accessibility for all, we have dedicated a standard amount in all activity budgets to meet accessibility needs ranging from audiovisual aids to language interpretation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Women&apos;s Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Womens Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific (IWRAW Asia Pacific) was founded in 1993 to work towards the realisation of the human rights of women through the use of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (the CEDAW Convention) and other international human rights instruments. The founders, a group of Asian women, wanted to link activism takingplace at the local level with that at the global level. By understanding and participating in international activities, women working at the local level would be able to monitor and facilitate the implementation of the CEDAW Convention domestically while contributing to standard-setting at the international level. Thirteen years later, IWRAW Asia Pacific works in 14countries in South and Southeast Asia and over 100 countries globally.
Phase 1: 1993-1996
In the first four years of its existence, IWRAW Asia Pacific worked towards strengthening national womens groups and alliances in Asia that could carry out and sustain CEDAW Convention-related work. The focus of the activities was centred on creating clarity of concepts pertaining to womens rights, especially the key principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, state obligation and accountability andthe expanded concept of womens rights as human rights. IWRAW Asia Pacific focused on inspiring womens groups to co-ordinate their work within a rights framework. It began looking at developing methodologies for analysing the various sites of discrimination, for developing holistic measures for achieving de facto equality of women and for training womens rights advocates on the CEDAW Convention and on claiming rights inside and outside courtprocedures. Due to its rights focus, IWRAW Asia Pacific was involved in regional and international advocacy, for instance, in the NGO preparations and participation in the International Conference on Population and Development in 1993, and the World Conference onWomen in Beijing in 1995.
Phase 2: 1997-2002
IWRAW AsiaPacific sharpened its approaches in bringing about domestic application of international human rights norms. It continued to prioritise creating and deepening conceptual clarity but now focused also on concretising this conceptual clarity through the development of methodologies for identifying and addressing discrimination against women in its various contexts, i.e. a monitoring tool to assess compliance with the CEDAW Convention, as well as on process and advocacy necessary for holding states accountable for violations.
IWRAW Asia Pacific continued to put strong focus on national-level capacity-building through social investigation visits, two regional trainings of trainers, national-level trainings, and issue-based technical assistance, among others.However, as a parallel indispensable strategy, we also facilitated a process by which national groups were able to build their own capacity through research-based advocacy, which also enabled them to participate in regional and international level advocacy. This move was made in the belief that activities at the national and international levels are interlinked and complementary. It ensures the bridging of the disconnect between the activities at the national and international levels.
Phase 3: 2003-2005
IWRAW Asia Pacific identified new areas of concern for this phase. At this stage, national groups were much more aware of the importance of the Convention and were engaging in activism at the international level as part of the larger strategy of promotingand claiming womens human rights at the national level. As a result, IWRAW Asia Pacific, in addition to continuing its focus on conceptual clarity and testing methodologies, expanded its work to:
- support the international work of its national partnersand constituencies;
- sustain advocacy to further understanding and domestic application of the principles of non-discrimination and equality;
-focus on providing technical assistance to national womens groups, including those in other regions, instead of organising trainings for them. In this way, local groups take ownership over the program by becoming responsible for securing funding for local costs of the training and crafting their own objectives and vision for the event; and
- develop a pool ofresource persons and trainers to assist in our technical assistance and capacity-building work.
As the CEDAW Committee and other human rights bodies progressively interpreted human rights standards in ways that complemented and crosscut their areas ofwork,IWRAW Asia Pacific engaged in advancing and integrating womens concerns into all human rights monitoring bodies. Our engagement here included:
- enhancing IWRAW Asia Pacificsadvocacy with regard to other treaty bodies, the UN Commission on Human Rights(now the Human Rights Council), and the UN Special Rapporteurs;
- integrating information on other major treaties and international and regional mechanisms into our national capacity-building component;
- developing a better understanding of womens economic, social and cultural rights; and
-  strengthening partnerships with mainstream human rights organisations working internationally and regionally.

IWRAW Asia Pacific focuses on women and womens NGOs from the South. We work primarily throughcollaborative projects at the international, national and local levels with women activists and NGOs; human rights advocates; lawyers; governments and international organisations.
As stated above, one reason for IWRAW Asia Pacifics uniqueness lies in its positioning as an international NGO based in the Global South, rather than in Geneva or New York. This positioning and our close contacts with local NGOs allow us to ground our analytical approach in the realities of NGOs and activists in the South sothat we canbetter address the structural causes that permit the violation of rights. Through this informed approach, we examine underlying causes of rights violations and strengths and weaknesses of State efforts and identify factors that are needed to create a culture of compliance with human rights norms and institutional frameworks and legal instruments that are needed for the administration of justice. This allows us to develop programs that aim at developing the capacity of people to claim rights and strengthenthe institutional framework necessary for this.

In addition, the strength of IWRAW Asia Pacifics positioning lies in the fact that we do not take up the causes of national level NGOs, but rather aim to play an enabling and facilitating role tobuild the capacity of local level activists to take up their causes directly and to participate in both their national debates and in international processes. Our programs relating to international human rights norms have brought greater cohesion toactivism at the national level. The presence of national level NGOs at international processes have earned them greater credibility and legitimacywith their own governments.
In addition, IWRAW Asia Pacific has a unique position with regard to the Committeeon the Elimination ofDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee), the treaty body that oversees compliance by States parties to the CEDAW Convention,in that the UN Division for the Advancement of Women has named IWRAW Asia Pacific as the official channelforpassing alternative information from NGOs to the CEDAW Committee when those NGOs governments are reporting. This provides IWRAW Asia Pacific with greater insight into the workings of the Committee and gives local NGOs greater access to the Committee and Committee members because they have an international NGO that is advocating for their participation in the CEDAW reporting process. The alternative information provided by national level NGOs institutes a necessary system of checks and balances, strengtheningpolitical constituencies and increasing the demand for greater transparency and accountability from governments.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PMRS is a grassroots, community-based Palestinian health organization. PMRS was founded in 1979 by a group of Palestinian doctors and health professionals seeking to supplement the decayed and inadequate health infrastructure caused by years of Israeli military occupation. It is non-profit, voluntary, and one of the largest health NGOs in Palestine. PMRS national health programs emphasize prevention, education, community participation, and the empowerment of people.

Since its inception, PMRS has grownfrom a small nucleusof volunteer health workers responding to the increasing healthcare needs in underserved areas, to a leading Palestinian health non-governmental organization (NGO). PMRS now extends its services to over 1.4 million Palestinians in theWest Bank and Gaza Strip, providing improved models of healthcare that are built on sound scientific bases and specifically adapted to the Palestinian context.  In the years prior to the Intifada, PMRS made a significant contribution to the creation of aPalestinian national health infrastructure, replacing the fragmented health system inherited from years of Israeli occupation.

PMRS role in health service provision, alongside the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH), United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) and other health NGOs, has steadily progressed. In light of this, PMRS has established strong links with the public health sector, leading to the creation of a subcontracting system between the MOH and PMRS and other NGOs, such that the MOH canmake use of their health services.

In addition, PMRS has developed its strategy to build model health programs, such as the Womens Health Program, Child Health Program, School Health Program, and Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Program. Based on its considerable experience in service provision; awareness of the needs and characteristics of local communities; professional expertise; and field worker commitment, PMRS develops models and protocolsthat can be tested in the field, and disseminated topublic and NGO sector institutions &#x96; at both local and regional level.

At the same time PMRS is highly involved in policy making at national level, to influence the adoption of legislation that supports civil society and the creation of a modern democratic state. PMRS works on this with other Palestinian NGOs through the Palestinian NGO network (PNGO) and other joint forums that link between the public and NGO sectors.

PMRS in Gaza employs about 100 people spread between the headquarters in Gaza City, its four clinics, one non communicable diseases (NCD) centre and two rehabilitation centers.  The organization also runs two mobile clinics which provide emergency primary health care to communities in marginalized and/or isolatedareas.  It also conducts awareness activities on various health, hygiene and social issues affecting peoples quality of life.  PMRSrelies on its network of around 150 volunteers to reach out to all levels of society all over the Strip.  First aid teams have beenactivated to face the emergency and save lives.  Moreover, PMRS has agreements with the Gaza Ministry of Health according to which the former refers patients  in need of secondary health care to the latter hospitals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam Novib has been active in the Occupied Palestinian Territory/Israel (OPT/I) since 1982 and working with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since the mid 1980s. It has built up a strong network of relationships with local NGOs and counts among its localcounterparts some of the largest and most professional NGOs in various sectors. It has accompanied these NGOs in their development from ad hoc volunteer groups to sizeable professional institutions with national outreach.  At the same time the conceptualisation of the programme has evolved from three country programs in the early 1990s to a program for Palestinians in the Middle East (PME) working withPalestinians in OPT, Israel and Lebanon.

The programme has changed over the years with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the mid-1990s from a focus on support and service provision at a grassroots level and grassroots mobilization, to working towards influencing the establishment of the PA, its lawmaking and supporting building a democratic state # this involved supporting efforts of Palestinian civil society to build the basis for a democratic Palestinian state with room for civil participation, ensuring inclusion of vulnerable groups, refugees and women, and shaping its laws and systems. Oxfam Novib has also supported partners that are working on the provision of humanitarian assistance, response preparedness and conflict transformation. We have also supported partners in the provision of health services, access to quality education and gender justice.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam in Uganda will manage and coordinate the COVID-19 response in partnership with local actors, Ministry Of Health, Local Governments, UNHCR and other health actors.  Oxfam in Uganda will ensure effective financial and project management support to partner andreport to the donor on progress and impact.

This action integrates and builds on the current ongoing projects in Imvepi and Rhino which includes 1) KfW WASH infrastructure project, 2) DANIDA funded Peace, Youth Skilling and Refugee EngagementProjects (through Oxfam IBIS) and HiF Projects. The action will strengthen COVID-19 sensitive community engagement (CE), social mobilization (SM) and risk communication (RC) components into these projects as well as build local level capacity (amongst refugee led organizations) on COVID-19 sensitive programming, and by extension ensure that poor, vulnerable and marginalized people get the adequate, inclusive and safe support to (a) prevent and reduce the infection risk of the COVID-19 disease outbreak; and (b) be protected from the negative impacts of state emergency measures to control and respond to the outbreak..
Building on previous engagement with Oxfam in Rhino and Imvepi on the Peace Building Project in 2019 (supported through Oxfam IBIS), Oxfam will work with Youth Social Advocacy Team (YSAT) in Rhino/Omugo Refugee settlement for COVID 19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement activities. Oxfam has worked with YSAT since 2018 on engaging South Sudan refugees as agents of peace project and Empowering the refugee and Host Communities on conflict transformation. Their presence and networks in the refugee settlement make them a critical ally to support large scale community engagement for social and behaviour change approaches that will ensure preventive community and individual health and hygiene practices, in line with the national public health containment recommendations


 Specific activities will include

# Capacity building of the VHT, and Oxfam and Partner (YSAT) on COVID-19 preparedness and response actions in line with MOH SOPs and Protocols). The training will focus on RC and CE
# Risk mapping and community level surveillance and design of appropriate response strategies in line with MOHguidelines
# Procurement of IPC suppliesnecessary for enhanced preparedness (such as PPEs, backpack sprayers, chlorine for disinfection etc).
# Procurement and installation of Bulk/Mass Handwashing Facilities at market places and communal meeting places includingFood Distribution Points
# Procurement and distribution of soap through door to door approach using the community structures on ground (VHTs, Hygiene promoters and the leaders) Printing and distribution of WHO and Ministry of Health (MOH) advisories and public health information onCOVID-19 and its prevention into preferred languages of refugees - To be done in close collaboration with MOH through the various task forces;.
# Hygiene promotion/ Public education / sensitization through mass media awareness such as radio spots shows ordrama or cinemas, boda-boda talks.
# Establishment of bucket chlorination points for point water sources (handpumps etc)
#Creation of a community perception tracking tool (CPT) through which community rumours, beliefs, ideas, concerns etc are collected,presented and analysed for discussion in coordination meetings.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">YSAT - Youth Social Advocacy Team, Ywill work in Rhino (and Omugo) Refugee settlement for COVID 19 Risk Communication and CommunityEngagement activities. Oxfam has worked with YSAT since 2018 on engaging South Sudan refugees as agents of peace project and Empowering the refugee and Host Communities on conflict transformation. Their presence and networks in the refugee settlement make them a critical ally to support large scale community engagement for social and behaviour change approaches that will ensure preventive community and individual health and hygiene practices, in line with the national public health containment recommendations

YSAT will mobilise the refugee communities in Arua to prevent COVID-19 infection and support any efforts to control it through the following activities:

  Provision of transport means in terms of bicycles for follow up and information dissemination within the community.
  Capitalize on the fact that the refugee leaders were given phones by UNHCR and then provide airtime for leaders for purposes of information sharing and feedback.
  Empower women groups to make local masks and then buy from them if it is allowed for people to use masks.
  Sensitization of the community in the local languages through;
# Boda-boda talk passing through the communities with messages
# Record messages to move with a police officer so that people do not come.
# Shot a two minutes video in the local languages
  Conducting massive handwashing i.e.
# Identification of useful spots and make handwashing mandatory.
# Installation of handwashing facilities and leaders shall help in monitoring the practices in the villages.
# Any 10 steps there should be handwashing within the villages
# Making handwashing mandatory at the water points (before fetching water, one should first wash their hands).
  Recognition and awarding the idea homestead through a Role model challenge (in terms of prices # soap and jerricans).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014, we saw Refugee Youth being the victims of the conflict and all forms of violence#s in South Sudan while escaping the 2013 Crisis, during transits, in reception Centers and in the clusters where they were settled by Office Prime Minister. We understood that Peaceful coexistence, love hope and recovery was vital given the high level of trauma, communities need to have a strong voice tostand for their needs. The gap between NGOs and Refugee Youth in the communities has to be bridged in a conflict sensitive manner as well as recognizing the Youth as potential partners for Peace and that led to the foundation  of Youth Social Advocacy Team.
 In June 2015, Five Young people (John Jal Dak, Amuna Vivian, Jacob Nhial Bol, Tabule Geoffrey, Narcisse Bakouroua) came up with an idea of Advocating for Youth Voices calling for Peace in Rhino Camp luckily our Team leader john Jal Dak was nominated for the UNHCR  Global Refugee Youth Consultations (GRYC) and while the final report was released, we got our organization name was add the word #Youth# that excite us given our founders being all young people, we resolved to rename Social Advocacy Team as #Youth Social Advocacy Team# . In July 2016 Full constitution was drafted, membership was established and key Voluntary Positions of Chairperson, Vice, Secretary General, Treasurer and Information were fully established. In March 2017, we got our registration as a community based organization and during the Word Refuge Day 2017, we were offered Office Space by DRC,UNHCR and OPM Jointly in Ocea A Village behind CatholicChurch of Nationals, this was our first recognition as one of the first refugee led CBOs in Rhino to start freshly in Uganda. In September 2017, we got our first partnership with r0g Agency in Berlinto implement #defyhatenow project. The organization attracted 26Youth Volunteers but with only 4 Female Volunteers the lowest ever# but now we are happy that we have more than 10 females and Advocate for more in order to close the gap. YSAT is in a process of registering as a National NGO in Uganda and South Sudan.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS
We have created awareness about peaceful coexistence to over 10,000 Youth, Women and Children through open air Music concerts,Dialogues, and conferences since 2017 in RhinoCamp and Omugo Extension. YSAT initiated the resolution of Tika Refugee Conflict, calling for the first ever Inter Cultural Dialogue for South Sudanese Refugees targeting the 64 tribes of South Sudanese Refugees as Non Violent Action to reconcile and heal the broken relationship between the communities that fought, as we talk now, Tika was announced during the Peace Campaign we held in Ocea Zone in January 2019 as #Peaceful Zone# by OPM/UNHCR jointly. We were able to partner with 6 Renown National &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; International Organizations including Oxfam Novib, Norwegian Peoples Aid (NPA), and r0g Agency for Open Culture in Berlin, African Non Profit Chore (ANCHOR), The Nexus Fund, PeaceTech Lab. We were able to record 80,000 USD Grant Fundsin the 2018/19 Fiscal Yearfor YSAT. In 2018 we completed the development of YSAT major policies that governs the Organization including appointment of YSAT Board of Directors and had several capacity building of our members by our partners NPA and r0g Agency for Open Culture.

The environment Community Empowerment for Creative Innovation (CECI) works in is diverse in cultures and ethnicity and is also characterised with some form of fear, ethnic divisions and violent conflicts, intolerance among others, besides being thickly populated by youth who, most suffered adversely armed conflicts, are traumatized,hopeless and idle.

Apart from government and business, other relevant social actors include church, associations/groups, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and institutions. These play roles that range from maintaining law and order, providing relief and humanitarian assistance, educational support, psychosocial and health care to social advocacy.

As the culture of CECI is to work always with the community and other relevant social actors such as earlier identified is in position to influence great positive change, inconsiderate of the closeness of the CECI to the community and the speaking of a common language used by the very diversecommunities we#re committed to serve as well as the diversity of the CECI team and its good relationship with the community, church, CBO/CSOs, and its better understanding of how the community feels.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">I CAN South Sudan COVID -19 Project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">I CAN was founded in 2017 by refugee youths Stephen Wandu Bimo, Seme Ludanga Faustino, and Kyobutungi Angela. It was initially funded with a Good Will support grant from Misereor, Germany, which enabled us to help 20 children over 6 months. We have sincedevelopedour programme and are now helping 56 unaccompanied refugee  children now in Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in Uganda.
I CAN South Sudan is a registered, refugee-led Community-Based Organization (CBO) operating in the Bidibidi Refugee Settlement, Yumbe District, Northern Uganda.
We use social and musical education to help a particularly vulnerable group: unaccompanied refugee children. Our aim isthree-folds:
# To give these children meaning, purpose and hope in their lives
# To develop their skills and talents for the future,
# To provide them with a voice to express their trauma and their desire for peace.
We use musical coaching with an emphasis on group work to build the children#s# confidence and to create friendships across the tribal divide that led to the South Sudanese civil war. Storytelling and song are important elements in South Sudanese culture, so the musical program focuses on the preservation of traditional stories, songs, and musical traditions. This provides the children with a link to their own culture, and preserves a sense of normality: South Sudanese evenings often involve children learning songs and stories. By teaching across the usual boundaries of tribal culture, the aim is to support peace-building efforts, fostering understanding and empathy across a cultural divide.
The organization that started in 2017 with only 3 founding members has grown to over 32 members. We first registered as a company limited by guarantee with the Uganda Registration Service Bureau but with the advice from Oxfam in 2019, we registered the organization as Community based organization at Yumbe district and officially got clearance by OPM and operating in the Child Protection Department under OPM Bidibidi. We started the organization with only 20 unaccompanied refugee children, now we have 56 children in Uganda, 24 children in Tambura, 20 Children in Yambio and 20 Children in Ibba South Sudan, summing up to 120 Children under our program.
The organization is well structured with seven (7)Prominent Board Members, (one from Norway, one US Citizen, one Ugandan and four South Sudanese) working in different International Organizations like UNHCR and UNICEF. The board is made up of 3 females and 4 males. The Executive is made up of between theage of 20-32 years, with females occupying 9 positions.
With the ongoing implementation of Revitalized Peace Agreement in South Sudan, I CAN South Sudan has registered in South Sudan as a National None Governmental Organization (NNGO) and has expanded its work to Tambura, Yambio and Ibba in South Sudan with the aim of reaching out to children and single mothers orphaned and affected by the recent civil war to heal them of trauma and to support the integration of returnee into the community. We dream to establish our services in all states across South Sudan.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">#According to Associated Press June 2017, Over 10,500 children arrived with strangers or relatives as they flee conflict from SouthSudan in 2016 that are not their parents and live in the Bidibidi and Imvepi refugee settlements in northern Uganda, according to World Vision, which has put more than 3,000 of them into foster care. The rest have been reunited with family, Talagwa said.
The children, referred to as unaccompanied minors, pose serious challenges for aid workers who quickly have to figure outwhat to do with them when they cross the border. Even when the children show maturity far beyond their years, they still need the care of foster parents who are vetted on many grounds, including a clear sense of kinship.#

It is upon the above report/article that we were motivated, inspired and touched to start I CAN South Sudan so as to engage the unaccompanied children in social and musical activities to heal them of trauma.
Created by refugee youth, Stephen Wandu Bimo (founder), Seme Ludanga Faustino (cofounder) and a Ugandan, Kyobutungi Angela (cofounder) in October 2017, I CAN South Sudan initially selected 20 unaccompanied refugee children in Bidibidi Refugee Settlement Zone 1 with the help of the community and started its activities at Chrisco Church, in May 2018, I CAN South Sudan received a Good Will support of Euro 5,000 from Misereor Germany to help the 20 children over 6 months. This support helped I CAN South Sudan to record a music album and shot one video for the unaccompanied children,giving them voice to express their desire for peace, unity,forgiveness, reconciliation and coexistence among South Sudanese. The children were also taken out to Zoo and beach in Entebbe and Freedom City. The children were periodically provided with scholastic materials, body lotion and soap

In 2019, the organization hasgrown from 3 founding members to 14 members that includes 5 ladies most of whom are in strategic positions. Above 50 children come for the I CAN practices and activities.
The organization has been registered both in South Sudan and Uganda and we have launched Artand drawing program in Rockland Primary school in Bidibidi Zone 1 that engage 40 children in art and drawing program and planting of fruits and distribute them to the households freely as a seed of peace.
In 2014, Yumbe district#s recorded population numbered roughly 485,000 Ugandans. Yumbe is the historic land of the Aringa people, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers and followers of Islam. Yumbe is one of the poorest districts in Uganda. Schools and health centres are severely under-resourced and underperforming, infrastructure is underdeveloped, and economic opportunities lag behind the rest of the nation. The Aringa#s history of conflict,poverty, and Islamic faith provide a backdrop of perceived and actual marginalization of the Aringa inside Uganda. Unlike other communities in northern Uganda, the Aringa do not report sharing direct ethnic ties to communities across the border in South Sudan; however, many Aringa are aware of distant kinship with many groups of South Sudan. The Aringa language is part of the Central Sudanic family, which also includes South Sudan&apos;s Ma#di, Avokaya and Moro languages. Aringa is distinct but related to the Lugbara spoken inArua. Aringa is variously categorized as a dialect of Lugbara or as a separate language of its own. Many Aringa speak both Aringa and common Lugbara. There are no known indigenous Aringa populations in South Sudan. However, some Aringa feel an affiliation with their South Sudanese neighbours as marginalized groups with shared historical and kinship links.


Relations between the host community and refugees are good due to the shared historical ties. Refugees and nationals are occasionally brought together for dialogues onpressing issues informing the response, which has also improved the delivery of services.

Bidi Bidi settlement was established in September 2016 to host the rapid influx of South Sudanese refugees, primarily arriving from the Equatoriaregion. The settlement population increased rapidly to over 280,000 people, making it one of the largest refugee settlements in the world. As of December 2016,Bidi Bidi reached maximum capacity and stopped accepting new arrivals.

According to RefugeeInformation Management System (RIMS) June 2018, The following are the gaps and challenges in Bidi Bidi Zone 1 and among the gaps and challenges, Child protection was reported as a significant gap in Bidi Bidi settlement. 96% of children PSNs need to be provided with individual case management, 21% of unaccompanied or separated children have not been provided with interim or long term care and 7% of cases in the past three months ofchild abuse or exploitation received age and gender services

There areonlyfew clean water sources available to the population in Bidi Bidi. Long distance to the water points, long waiting lines and high congestion are issues facing refugees collecting water. Thefew existing boreholes are of poor quality, nationals reported repairs of the boreholes are continuously delayed. The water supplied is insufficient, which is exacerbated by the dry season. As sources dry up, both refugees and nationals are forced to collect water from unprotected water sources. Furthermore, the poor latrine coverage in the settlement has led to increased open defecation, which further deteriorates the hygiene and sanitation in Bidi Bidi.
Access to quality education is limited for both refugees and the surrounding host community. Schools are few with insufficient classrooms and insufficient teachers leading to low teacher per student ratios. This was reported to severely inhibit the students# learning environment. This is further deteriorated by the lack of schoolmaterials and lack of training for teachers. Moreover, the absence of vocational training institutions limits the opportunities available for students unable to access secondary school or those unable to access tertiary education. This significantly reduces theirchances to access livelihoodsopportunities in the future.
Refugees were provided with non-food items (NFIs), such as saucepans, solar lamps, mattresses and jerry cans, upon arrival to the settlement. These have, however not been re-distributed since the refugees&apos;arrival, which therefore means they are for the most part worn out or broken. This forces refugees to share with their neighbors and take it in turns to cook. The lack of access to functional NFIs reduces the living standards of refugees.
Both refugees and nationalsface important challenges in accessing livelihoods opportunities. Refugees, in particular, struggle to access land for agricultural activities. The land provided to them upon arrival is insufficient to cultivate crops and the cost of hiring land is expensive. Moreover, those that do have access to land struggle to harvest their crops as the land is infertile and they have not received improved seeds adapted to the harsh climate conditions. Nationals highlighted they also struggle to access livelihoods trainingopportunities preventing them from acquiring the skills needed for employment.
Child protection was reported as a significant gap in Bidi Bidisettlement. Refugee#s highlighted child-headed households are not provided with the appropriate servicesthey need. Moreover, children, particularly young girls, are often sent to collect firewood for their families far from the settlement, which has led to cases of rape and sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). Additionally, theft was reported to be an issue in the settlement where food items are often stolen at night.

Hence this is why we find our social services important in individual case management of the children, to provide interim and long term therapy care and advocate for children#s rights.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. HISTORY:
          Community Action for Transformation or CAFOT is started in August of 2017 desired to engage the refugees youth in particular and the host community in comprehensive peace building, Hygiene and sanitation promotion and advocating for a quality education as a mean of building resilience and health living among the south Sudanese and host communities. The organization was started by a group of young people with the vision; to create a safe and peaceful atmosphere for human race including his God-given plan, domestic and wild- life and to deliver socio-economic development. So far the organization has improved since its formation andit also has taken gender mainstreaming as co in achieving its vision through programming, planning, andimplementation.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS:
       So far there is a resilient building among the refugee and the host community through the public forums that CAFOT already carried on since the beginning of 2018.
There is trust building among the young people, youth are already getting into groups to start up small business as a means to fight poverty and building a stronger relationship
Through our established school, the children are progressively moving in a right direction to face the future, this is meantto ensure illiteracy in removed completely in our society.
3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE:
Mission:  To see a reduced rate of the prevailing trauma, conflict and to build a health livingamong the refugees and host communities by provision of education, creation of awareness on hygiene and sanitation through participatory drama (forum theatre) and music.
  a. Institutional objectives:
1. To Open Adult literacy classes, Nursery and lower primary classes
2. To empower the rural women by providing trainingson basic business entrepreneurship skills, and creation of income generating activities
3. To create a flat form for communities to interact on societal issues that affect their living and adopt on the dynamics of the modern change as relates to positive resilience in community development.
4. To promote Hygiene and sanitation, as wellas unity, equality with gender sensitivity, justice and everlasting peace in the community through advocacy and other measures where necessary
5. To create awareness oncorruption, gender-based violence, promote leadership and good governance
6. To promote social understanding among, youth, women, elderly, children and families as a whole, through creation of forum theatre, debates and dialogue this gives them an opportunity to share their own experiences
7. To build the capacities of organized youth groups, drama groups, women associations, RWCs, religious leaders, Boda Boda associations, Taxi Drivers and brokers association, Market management committee, football clubs, local artists, water management committees, Hygiene promoters, Village girl child education promoters (VGCEP) among others through networking meetings and trainings to increase awareness to the grass root

   a). Field(s) of activity:
         1. Education: We use Physical education which is an integral part of educational program design to promote the optimum development of an individual physically, socially, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually through total body movement in the performance of properly selected physical activities. It is a process by which changes in the individual are brought about through movement#s experiences and it aims not only at physical development but is also concerned with education of the whole person through physical activities.
       2. Hygiene and sanitation: Sanitation refers to public health conditions related to clean drinking water and adequate treatment and disposal of human excreta and sewage. Preventing human contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal#oral route. For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stuntedgrowth in children, can be reduced through sanitation. There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low levels of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, trachoma, to name just a few
      3. Peace building awareness programs: Peacebuilding is an activity that aims to resolve injustice in nonviolent ways and to transform the cultural &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; structural conditions that generate deadly or destructive conflict. It revolves around developing constructive personal, group, and political relationships across ethnic, religious, class, national, and racial boundaries. This process includes violence prevention; conflict management, resolution, or transformation; and post-conflict reconciliation or trauma healing, i.e., before, during and after war.
We are currently in Imvepi refugee settlement, but with a plan to reach Rhino and Bidibidi settlements
Who are the social actors that benefit from the work? We target youth, (men, women, girls and boys)
4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING:
       We work directly with the office of the prime minster who is a principle representative of the government on ground, the church leaders, and local chiefs andalready established associations including the line ministries. These actors are supporters of our programs and they act like technical advisors in the day today running of community activities.
5. FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATIONAL CHART
       In the current board of director, out of seven members, the three are female. We have the Director who is a male and the program manager, while the position of the finance is a female , While the community mobilisers are a mixture of both male and female altogether.
6.CURRENT BALANCE SHEET/FINANCIAL POSITION
       We have not yet received much funding as a newly established organization apart from being funded on activities basis. This means we always relay on the contribution of our members and the volunteers.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Desert Locust Joint Response is a 6 month emergency response project focusing on FSL and Cash interventions to control the spread of locust and support communities (agropastoralists and pastoralists) in coping with the loss of livelihoods due to locust invasions. All activities will be accompanied by COVID-19 WASH preparedness interventions, focusing on Public Health Promotion and the distribution of hygiene items. SOS Somaliland is the lead for this Joint Response (DRA). Oxfam will deliver the project with partners Candlelight and KAALO, who will work in Eastern Somaliland and Puntland (Togdheer, Sool, Nugal). Oxfam will respond in Awdal and Togdheer.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Desert Locust Joint Response is a 6 month emergency response project focusing on FSL and Cash interventions to control the spread of locust and support communities (agropastoralists and pastoralists) in coping with the loss of livelihoods due to locust invasions. All activities will be accompanied by COVID-19 WASH preparedness interventions, focusing on Public Health Promotion and the distribution of hygiene items. SOS Somaliland is the lead for this Joint Response (DRA). Oxfam will deliver the project with partners Candlelight and KAALO, who will work in Eastern Somaliland and Puntland (Togdheer, Sool, Nugal). Oxfam will respond in Awdal and Togdheer.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">KAALO Aid and Development is a non-profit humanitarian and development organization established in Somalia in 1991 just after the collapse of the central government. KAALO works in Nugal, Mudug, Bari, Sool, Sanaag and Karkaar regions and plans to expand services to cover more regions of Somalia.

KAALO#s vision is a #Society free of ignorance and poverty# and its mission is to improve the livelihoods of communities in Somalia by supporting the provision of basic needs in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner. Currently the key program areas for KAALO are education and research, democracy, human rights, governance and rule of law, livelihood and community empowerment, agriculture and rural infrastructure, health water and sanitation. Current funding partners for KAALO include UNHCR, UNHABITAT, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), Diakonia, Danish People#s Aid (DPA), Oxfam Novib and Caritas International Belgium.

KAALO has been in partnership with Oxfam since 2006.

Counterpart International in Washington USA contributed the shipment.
# Carried out the first public building relocation program since the collapse of the last Central government in 1993 - 94 in Nugal region of Somalia.
# Established the first professional training institute, Garowe School of Management, in Puntland in 1999. Renamed Puntland Community College in 2001 and grew to become Puntland State University in 2004.

  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TThe Desert Locust Joint Response is a 6 month emergency response project focusing on FSL and Cash interventions to control the spread of locust and support communities (agropastoralists and pastoralists) in coping with the loss of livelihoods due to locust invasions. All activities will be accompanied by COVID-19 WASH preparedness interventions, focusing on Public Health Promotion and the distribution of hygiene items. SOS Somaliland is the lead for this Joint Response (DRA). Oxfam will deliver the project with partners Candlelight and KAALO, who will work in Eastern Somaliland and Puntland (Togdheer, Sool, Nugal). Oxfam will respond in Awdal and Togdheer.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CANDLELIGHT FOR ENV .EDU AND HEALTH</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Candle Light for Health and Education (CLHE) works in the Toghdeer region of Somalia and was founded in 1995. Its mandate is to contribute to setting up sustainable structures in education and healthcare.
Its most important target group consists of women and other marginalised groups, such as returning refugees. CHLE is also working with former militia members and tries to integrate them in society.
CLHE works closely with the local authorities, leaders and others. Its work includes formal and informaleducation, training,preventive healthcare, rehabilitating small school buildings, and small-scale income generating activities. CLHE also works on the environment. It is of the opinion that deforestation has a negative impact on cattle, which has negative consequences for people&apos;s health and nutrition. Not enough good grazing land and a lack of water increase people&apos;s mobility, disrupting education programs.
Therelationship between Oxfam Novib and CLHE began in 1996. CLHE&apos;s organisation capacities havesince improved.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Description of the crisis (including number of affected, timeline, number of affected Oxfam has reached to date etc):
COVID-19 (Coronavirus acute respiratory disease) was first identified in late 2019 in Wuhan in Hubei province, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing pandemic. While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced. The below activities would provide Oxfam Somalia and our partners with a top-up to the 50,000 GBP recently received through the CAT Fund.
Project description / activities (including numbers to be reached):
An additional 100,000 GBP (50% as loan, 50% as grant) will enable Oxfam and our partners to scale up the WASH preparedness activities as well as support partner Shaqodoon on extending the COVID-19 helpline to Somalia#s Puntland State. Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April. The helpline in Puntland willfollow the same process as in Somaliland: Shaqodoon will develop the system and link it to a toll-free Coronavirus hotline providedby Puntland#s Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will work closely with WHO and identify health personnel who will be trained in receiving and processing calls. Shaqodoon will provide pre-recorded health messages, on-site technical support and data analysis/dashboards for the Ministry.

The remaining amount will be utilised to scale up COVID-19 preparedness activities in Somaliland and Puntland, in collaboration with partners. Itwill also be used to top-up partners# crisis modifiers from other donors to make theircontribution in this fight, more meaningful. Activities include set-up of handwashing points in settlements, purchase and distribution of hygiene kits to IDP communities, dispatching mobile teams to disinfect busy public areas and purchase of HTH chlorine pumps for disinfection.

50,000 people will be reached by Oxfam#s and partners# WASH COVID-19 preparedness activities.
Shaqodoon through the Ministry of Health of Puntland hopes to reach a majority of Puntland#s phone users with COVID-19 information sharing and prevention messaging.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Description of the crisis (including number of affected, timeline, number of affected Oxfam has reached to date etc):
COVID-19 (Coronavirus acute respiratory disease) was first identified in late 2019 in Wuhan in Hubei province, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing pandemic. While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced. The below activities would provide Oxfam Somalia and our partners with a top-up to the 50,000 GBP recently received through the CAT Fund.
Project description / activities (including numbers to be reached):
An additional 100,000 GBP (50% as loan, 50% as grant) will enable Oxfam and our partners to scale up the WASH preparedness activities as well as support partner Shaqodoon on extending the COVID-19 helpline to Somalia#s Puntland State. Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April. The helpline in Puntland willfollow the same process as in Somaliland: Shaqodoon will develop the system and link it to a toll-free Coronavirus hotline providedby Puntland#s Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will work closely with WHO and identify health personnel who will be trained in receiving and processing calls. Shaqodoon will provide pre-recorded health messages, on-site technical support and data analysis/dashboards for the Ministry.

The remaining amount will be utilised to scale up COVID-19 preparedness activities in Somaliland and Puntland, in collaboration with partners. Itwill also be used to top-up partners# crisis modifiers from other donors to make theircontribution in this fight, more meaningful. Activities include set-up of handwashing points in settlements, purchase and distribution of hygiene kits to IDP communities, dispatching mobile teams to disinfect busy public areas and purchase of HTH chlorine pumps for disinfection.

50,000 people will be reached by Oxfam#s and partners# WASH COVID-19 preparedness activities.
Shaqodoon through the Ministry of Health of Puntland hopes to reach a majority of Puntland#s phone users with COVID-19 information sharing and prevention messaging.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam Novib has been active in the Occupied Palestinian Territory/Israel (OPT/I) since 1982 and working with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since the mid 1980s. It has built up a strong network of relationships with local NGOs and counts among its localcounterparts some of the largest and most professional NGOs in various sectors. It has accompanied these NGOs in their development from ad hoc volunteer groups to sizeable professional institutions with national outreach.  At the same time the conceptualisation of the programme has evolved from three country programs in the early 1990s to a program for Palestinians in the Middle East (PME) working withPalestinians in OPT, Israel and Lebanon.

The programme has changed over the years with the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the mid-1990s from a focus on support and service provision at a grassroots level and grassroots mobilization, to working towards influencing the establishment of the PA, its lawmaking and supporting building a democratic state # this involved supporting efforts of Palestinian civil society to build the basis for a democratic Palestinian state with room for civil participation, ensuring inclusion of vulnerable groups, refugees and women, and shaping its laws and systems. Oxfam Novib has also supported partners that are working on the provision of humanitarian assistance, response preparedness and conflict transformation. We have also supported partners in the provision of health services, access to quality education and gender justice.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide emergency response to the most vulnerable households (HHs) in Nangarhar who are food insecure as they are living under the poverty line and were already struggling to manage their minimum food requirements, it is worsened by the loss of income/earning opportunity and thus purchasing power, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan.

Through the proposed project Oxfam and long-term strategic partner Organization for Human Welfare (OHW) will provide cash assistance to a total of 39,400 individuals (5662 HHs) in Jalalabad district of Nangarhar province to buy food items. Based on the cluster standards and the allocation strategy paper, every eligible beneficiary HHs will receive AFN 6500 (equivalent to USD90). This amount isbased on the Cash Voucher Working Group (CVWG) and Food Security &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) recommended full basket food items for one month (calculated based on 2,100 kcal/person/day food need of an average size family and the market price of food items). Market price monitoring willbe done before and after each distribution to verify the feasibility and appropriateness of the cash amount. Cash for Food was preferred by the majority of the persons interviewed during the needs assessment since the local markets are operational. The Market Assessment confirmed that access is available but limited due to the lockdown; the markets are permitted to operate specific days in a week and there is supply of basic food items.

Oxfam#s interventions will be guided by the Integrated Food-Security Phase Classification (IPC) and Seasonal Food Security Assessment (SFSA) findings. As per IPC and SFSA, Nangarhar province was already in Crisis Situation (IPC3). Around 46% of the population in Nangarhar (1,237,262 individuals) were estimated to be at IPC3 or above during the period of April-May 2020. The prevalence is higher in the urban area as 50% of the population in Urban area of Nangarhar (210,326 individuals) are found to be at IPC 3 or above. This project will support the most food-insecure population in urban area of Nangarhar Province, Jalalabad City. FSAC identified that protracted IDPs are among the worst hit in terms of food insecurity, in the changed context of COVID-19. This project will target them so that they can survive without adopting harmful coping strategies and reduce theirrisk of exposure to the deadly virus.
Protection will be integrated across the project cycle by raising awareness among the women and men about their rights. Women#s rights will be discussed in country context, gender-based violence (GBV) impacts, measures to mitigate GBV and ways of getting support in case of rights violation, GBV or other protection concerns. The women and men of the selected HHs will also be made aware ofCOVID-19 risks, prevention methods and other vital information in this regard; this will be done with no additional cost except staff time. Oxfam uses the tailored awareness raising manual, which is developed based on UNFPA and GBVcluster tools and contextualized to Afghanistan and Islam. COVID-19 Awareness raising messages developed by Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) with the support of World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF in the languages of Afghanistan will be used for this purpose.

Oxfam will integrate conflict sensitivity into the action, by conducting context and conflict analysis of the target areas. This is especially important as cash assistance can work as potential flashpoint in creating new conflict or exacerbating existing tensions.
The grant of USD 689,400 will save lives of 39,400 persons (USD 17.49 per person) with USD 509,580 (73.9%) of the total funding directly going towards Cash for Food.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam proposes a structured and timely response to the increased protection needs of IDPs, returnees
and host communities in Herat and Daikundi provinces of Afghanistan. Oxfam aims to assist 34,560
individuals (6,912 men; 6,566 women; 10,714 boys and 10,368 girls) who are severely affected by
conflicts, flood, drought and COVID-19, by providing protection and Gender Based Violence (GBV)
services, which include a multisector response (legal, safety, health and psychosocial) through door-to
door outreach and referrals that facilitate community-based specialized services. Women and girls#
survivors are provided with dignity kits in Women Friendly Health Spaces (WFHS), information
dissemination through media broadcasts on women rights to increase awareness, GBV and case
management, referral, and follow-up of protection cases.
Oxfam will adopt an integrated approach, leveraging protection activities aligned with the priorities laid
out in the AHF 3rd Reserve Allocation-2020 with the eventual objective of recovery and resiliencebuilding
in the target communities. Provision of immediate protection assistance will alleviate suffering
of beneficiaries in a gender sensitive manner and increase their resilience.
Considering the fact that there are other actors in the area, in collaboration with them the following
areas are agreed to be covered by Oxfam:
Herat Province:
Injil: Sofian, Rezeshk, Doghabad, Baland Shahi, Tallab Rawashan, Maldan and Robat Qoloq.

Seyasang Ghojurbash.
Nawamish: Dasht Khair Abad, Orkhan, Awtak, Hussain Abad.
The main objectives of the project are to: save lives, alleviate suffering and protect human dignity for
the most vulnerable, supportpeople to build their resilience and increase capacity on human rights and
women#s rights to reduce protection violations, and increase respect for international humanitarian law
through protection services.
Oxfam#s protection program provides awareness raising as well as practical support, through Women
Friendly Health Spaces (WFHS), psychosocial, legal services, referral of beneficiaries with protection
concerns to other service providers. Oxfam has achieved concrete successes in environments such as
Herat and Daikundi provinces and has an established presence in these provinces. To build on this
work, Oxfam will use the AHF 3rd Reserved Allocation-2020 funding to increase the scope and scale of
its protection activities, and to conduct awareness raising through media broadcasting in TV/radio
programming to a wider population. AHF 3rd RA 2020#s contribution to this project will support
returnees, displaced and host communities to undertake protection awareness raising, and train
community-based protection committees (CBPC) for sustainability of the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the the Ministry of Health (MOH) needs, EL SPACE and it#s community of makers have first designed and tested a face shield(TN Mask 2020) with a plastic visor, which protects users from respiratory secretions and droplets emitted by COVID-19 patients. The prototype was developed in just two days by engineers and is based on several open source prototypes available on the internet. The final prototype is composed of four elements: a headband with adjustable plastic closures printed in 3D, a reinforcement strip printed in 3D, a visor made from transparent acetate film A4 format, and an elastic type buttonhole. The model has been approved by doctors form the Greater Tunis area, after several exchanges and returns the final prototype has been approved by the Ministry of Health.
Once production starts, and in order to better coordinate the action, one or two points of contact (POC) would be designated at each volunteer hub (ex. Jamaity, Iwatch). To ensure everyone#s safety, the production will be done at EL FABSPACE where only qualified and authorized personnel is allowed to enter. The finished products are then collected by the POCs.
To manage production and distribution, the project team will be using a dynamic database to plan and collaborate, which allows to follow production and deliveriesin real-time.
While using 3D printing was the most practical and simplest option to start immediate production, there are two othersolutions to speed up production, in addition to 3D printing, and respond to the huge and urgent demand which is about using laser cutting, vinyl cutting and CNC machining to increase production rates.
To meet this challenge, the collective will need mainly raw materials, a Vinyl Cutter and a 3D printers to increase productioncapacity at EL FABSPACE.
Once the machines and raw materials are inplace, production starts at a rate of about 100 units/day, which would be distributed to volunteers through partner nonprofits, therefore we achieve a better protection and a lower riskof contamination.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in 2012, Connected Development [CODE] is a non-government organization [NGO] whose mission is to empower marginalized communities in Africa. We strengthen local communities by creating platforms for dialogue, enabling informed debate, and building capacities of citizens on how to hold their government accountable through Follow the Money.

CODE provides marginalized and vulnerable communities with resources to amplify their voices with independence and integrity while providing the communities with information that ushers social and economic progress.  To enhance effective  democratic  governance and accountability, CODE creates platforms  [mobile  and  web  technologies]  that  close  the  feedback  loop  between  citizens  and  the government.

We are activists, advocates, educators, mobilisers, community champions, volunteers, journalists.

Our Vision:
We envision a world where all people - even in the most remote areas of the globe can hold their government accountable.

Our Mission:
To empower marginalized communities

Our Objectives:
1.   Increase people#s access to information through whatever technological means they choose.
2.   Increase    and    share    innovative    approaches    to    information    exchange     through experimentation, research, and technology.
3.   Develop innovative platforms for coverage of social, environmental and governance issues.
4.   Increase the adoption and implementation of international development laws and policies.

Our Core Focus Areas:
1.   Follow The Money
2.   Advocacy and Policy Influencing
3.   Citizens Mobilisation

Our Core Values
#   Integrity
#   Commitment
#   Partnership
#   Freedom of information

Follow The Money is a signature campaign of CODE through whichwe advocate, visualize and track government and international aid funds earmarked for capital projects for the provision of Health, WASH and Education services in rural communities. Over the past five years we have tracked projects in over 50 communities,impacting over 600,000 lives so far.
We employ both traditional and new media to amplify the voices of the people in the communities where we carry out campaigns. Follow The Money Radio (in Abuja and Kaduna) ensures that a large percentage of the grassroot population are able to participate in conversations about campaigns.

Online social media engagements also ensure that we reach a critical mass of the youth population, majority of which are on various social media platforms.
Using traditional mediato tell our stories
On the Strategic Partnership/Conflict &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Fragility project, CODE will work on three major outcomes;
1. Influence Financial institutions that invest in commodity trading companies strengthen their policies on human rights, illicit financial flows and conflict-sensitivity
CODE will carry out series of outreaches to amplify the voices of targeted communities negatively affected by the business practices of commodity traders. The key messages from these communities will be further directed to commodity traders and other relevant stakeholders to inform the discourse on the importance of a policy shift that can influence thedecision-making process of the policies of companies that influence the business practices of these commodity traders.

Furthermore, sensitization campaigns in the communities located close to the operating areas of commodity traders will occur through town hall meetings in order for communities to take ownership of the campaign and independently take the lead on monitoring the activities of commodity traders to ensure these activities occur in a conflict-sensitive and human rights-enhancing manner. Since this is a form of civic engagement, it will lead to an increase in the accountability and transparency of commodity traders# business practices.

2.Strengthened regulation of the investments by commodity traders in the oil and gas industry
Both home and host states as well as regional bodies such as the EU should implement regulations that foster accountabilityand transparency of commodity traders, enhance conflict-sensitive investments and ensure these companies pay tax revenues. For CODE a good point to start will be to further the campaign on country by country reporting and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting-BEPS, which aims to provide automatic information to countries on companies operating within their jurisdictions, looking at tax liabilities, revenue base, owners of the companies, beneficiaries of such companies and many other factors bothering ondevelopmental strides in Nigeria.

Because the risk of gross human rights abuses is heightened in conflict affected areas, states should help ensure that business enterprises operating in those contexts are not involved with such abuses. According to theUN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), they can do so by denying access to public support and services for a business enterprise that is involved with gross human rights abuses and refuses to cooperate in addressing the situation, and byensuring that their current policies, legislation, regulations and enforcement measures are effective in addressing the risk of business involvement in gross human rights abuses.  Where #host# States are unable to protect human rights adequately due toa lack of effective Protection/control, international standards holds sway for such companies #home# States have roles to play in assisting both those corporations and host States to ensure that businesses are not involved with human rights abuses. ThedraftNational Action Plan on Business and Human Rights currently domiciled with the National Human Rights Commission is an excellent document and policy piece to implement, its adaption by the Federal Executive Council in Nigeria will be a great mile stoneto achieve. This will give legitimacy to campaigns and advocacies on companies that do not respect human rights within their jurisdictions and value chain, in terms of helping these companies (in this case Vitol) to show internal polices of respectinghuman rights within their entre value chain and reporting same to the corporate affairs commission- a government body responsible for registering all existing companies in Nigeria.

One of CODE#s strength as an organization is its ability to carry out campaigns at national, subnational and community level.  CODE in collaboration with Oxfam Nigeria will map out the activities of Nigerian institutions and CSOs engaged in ensuring adequate regulation of commodity traders and organize a workshop for CSOstomechanize strategies and identify gaps to further engage in a high-level advocacy with Nigerian regulatory institutions. The mapping will be carried out to ensure there is no duplication of efforts in the activities of CSOs to enhance the regulation of the investment of commodity traders. Duplication of efforts is likely to impede on the expected outcome of improving these regulations and further inhibit the progress made by other CSOs in the past.

In addition, CODE will work with existing networksto devise strategies to push for the adoption of the UNGP Nigeria NAP through campaigns, that is, courtesy calls, public awareness creation on old and new media platforms, as well as peaceful rallies.

3. Improve the Policies and conflict sensitive business practicesof commodity traders in the oil and gas industry enhanced.
Commodity traders should avoid inflaming conflicts and violence. In order to do so, companies should be aware of the history of the political and social environment, identify potential points oftension and hostility, and conduct intervention activities in a way which is sensitive to these.  Town hall meetings on peace building between communities and companies. This will bring the parties together and identify areas of need by the communitiesfor possible intervention by these companies. Issues of compensation, CSR, employment, and remediation mechanism will be highlighted, recommendations made for possible implementation.

The intermediate change involves an increased awareness and political will to create an environment where oil and gas traders globally can be held accountable, this will be facilitated by our international colleagues working on the same campaign at that level.
Activities that contribute to these changes area research, capacity building of local CSOs and the development of a joint influencing strategy. This will also include media round table with journalist and oil and gas sector practitioners on reporting, implementing the recommendations, and filing annual feedback toprogress to the regulating institutions-Corporate Affairs Commission-CAC.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam and our partners believe that accurate and reliable information on Covid-19 will save lives: currently, we are already responding and reaching more than 40,000 people directly with WASH services and more than 650,000 people in Somaliland and Puntland via the Covid-19 helplines this proposal seeks to support.  Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.
The Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 callsso far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identifiedthrough the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.

This project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helpline service in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam and our partners believe that accurate and reliable information on Covid-19 will save lives: currently, we are already responding and reaching more than 40,000 people directly with WASH services and more than 650,000 people in Somaliland and Puntland via the Covid-19 helplines this proposal seeks to support.  Toll-free Covid-19 helplines our partner Shaqodoon is running in the Ministries of Health in Somaliland and Puntland have been launched in mid-April and beginnning of May respectively. The call centres utilize an interactive voice response system providing up to date information related to Covid-19 to the community. People can call the hotline and receive WHO-approved pre-recorded messages on COVID-19, check symptoms, and also talk to a healthofficers if they wish to doso. They can also leave a voicemail and will be called back. The system can be accessed free of charge through mobile phones for callers using a 3-digit shortcode.
The Somaliland hotline has registered more than 651,366 callsso far (as of 19 May), highlighting the thirst of people across Somaliland for accurate and reliable information on Covid-19.  A number of risk cases have been identifiedthrough the helplines already, and people tested as a result of their call and guidance received. Shaqodoon is highlighting common misinformation on Covid-19 gathered through calls as well as stats on calls, follow-up and regional origin of callers on dashboards which support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners in addressing needs in a timely manner. They also produce weekly dashboards to provide the Ministry of Health with an overview of calls, levels of (mis-)information per region and necessary follow-up.

This project would support Shaqodoon in extending the helpline service in collaboration with the Ministries of Health for another 2months until June/July, reaching a majority of the population in Puntland and Somaliland (at least 60% of the population) with accurate and timely information, guidance and symptoms checking, while at the same time ensuring call center staff and Ministry of Health officials receive adequate protection and safe programming support to deal with sensitive data and critical cases.  Their work will be accompanied by the installment of innovative hands-free handwashing stations designed and produced in the TVET centres of partner Havoyoco. These measures will reach another 30,000 people across Somaliland.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently there is an information gap regarding what COVID-19 is, its symptoms and prevention, and in Mozambique, misconceptions and rumors are rife. People living in informal settlements, those who are homeless, women, girls and boys, older persons, people with disabilities and all other groups vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic need to have continuous access to sufficient and affordable water supply to enable them to practice handwashing.
With the appropriate messaging and awareness, alongside relevant WASH interventions, OXFAM aims to inform the public on the symptoms and updates regarding COVID19 to reduce the risks and spread of disease.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tutoring students of primary schools in Tahoua and Maradi following the closure of schools due to the pandemic Covid-19
Oxfam in Niger with funding from SP DANIDA through Oxfam IBIS is implementing the Education For Active Citizenship (EFAC) project in 40 primaryschools in the Maradi and Tahoua regions. The objective of this project is to mobilize, through advocacy, the financial resources necessary to improve the quality of education and vocational training in Niger. These 40 primary schools have a total of 10,753 students, including 4,613 girls, who are suffering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To minimize the spread and impact of the disease in schools, the EFAC project redirected funds from certain activities to take action to combat COVID-19. An amount of 27,786 Euros is redirected for awareness-raising activities in schools and the purchase of hand washing devices and hydroalcoholic gels. These actions will be initiated when the schools reopen. As part of the fight against the COVID-19pandemic, the State of Niger has implemented several preventive measures to limit the spread of the disease. Among these preventive measures, there is the closure of allschools and universities in the country from March 19, 2020. Despite the reopening ofschools scheduled for June 1, 2020 for a period of 45 days, it will be very difficult to cover school time lost, therefore claiming to ensure a certain quality of teaching-learning. This gap, in terms of lost school time, will result in pupils in rural areas finding themselves with a significant drop in school levels compared to those expected in normal times. This drop in level is likely to jeopardize their transition to higher class thefollowing year.
&#xA0;Based on the logic in which the school year willbe validated, which means that pupils, despite their below normal levels, will move up to the higher class for the 2020-2021 school year. So if this situation which is inexorably looming on the horizon occurs, it is very likely that a situation of massive dropout of pupils will occur in schools, especially those from vulnerable rural families; because these children will not be able to hold on because they have not acquired the minimum required to appropriate the teachings / learnings of the passage classes.
This situation of massive dropout of students could be more acute at the level of transition classes, in particular CM2 classes (last year of primary) and CI classes (first year of primary). That is to say, many CM2 students will go to college without having the required level, which would lead to frustrations which will result in dropouts and dismissals during or at the end of the school year. This will cause many children to lose their right to education, and would expose girls to another scourge,namely early marriage.
To respond to this massive dropout situation linked to the COVID-19 pandemic in the intervention areas of the EFAC project, Oxfam in Niger is seeking funding through this concept-note to provide educational support to students ingrades 5 and 6 CI of partner schools of the EFAC project which are the most exposed.
This intervention, which lasts two (2) months from June 15 to August 15, 2020, essentially aims to offer Support Courses to students in CM2 and CI classes to improve their levels to allow them to keep in the upper classes. The choice of these students is justified by the fact that they are in transition classes and those most exposed to wastage. A total of 4,115 students including 1,811 girls. These students are distributedas follows: 2010 CM2 students including 775 girls and 2105 CI students including 1036 girls.</narrative>

  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this part of the world where displacement and utmost poverty are prevalent with no properly
functioning health systems, it is hard to imagine how adversely impactful a COVID-19 outbreak will be.
People are already extremely vulnerable to bear yet another distressing crisis. While all countries need to
respond to COVID-19, countries with existing humanitarian crisis coupled with weak governance are
particularly vulnerable. When COVID-19 affects countries with protracted humanitarian crises like
Somalia/land, vulnerable populations, particularly women headed households, the disabled and the
elderly living in overcrowded camps or informal urban settlements will be highly vulnerable to the disease
and its social and economic impacts unless support is given on preventative measures.The number of
people in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, around 5.2 million currently, will likely sharply
increase in the event of COVID-19 outbreak making the already fragile situation much worse. The Locust
infestation is another evolving crisis andif not addressed will also have significant impact on the food
security and livelihoods of the people.
COVID-19 crisis will have a different and far-reaching impact on poor people, especially the vulnerable.
Anyone can be exposed to the virus but the poor are most vulnerable as they lack financial and social
protections. Overcrowded IDP settlements and poor urban slums are also going to be the places where
disease can spread easily and quickly. To effectively address the urgent and acute humanitarian dimension
of the crisis, we need to frame that within our understanding of how inequality plays out. Women will be
as susceptible to getting infected by the virus but their need for support is greater because, as in any crisis,
women including elderly women, bear the greater responsibility of caring for the family and making both
ends meet. Women#s multiple burdens of needing to contribute to the household income while also taking
care of the young, theelderly and the sick mean they have the longest days, the shortest rest and the
highest stress, making them easy targets of disease.
Containment measures and their economic fallout are likely to hurt more than the disease itself, and for
longer. Restrictions on movement and market access will affect many households# income and coping
strategies in Somalia/land, including households who were relatively well off before the pandemic. As well
as short term support we need to consider howto provide support to those affected over the longer term.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this part of the world where displacement and utmost poverty are prevalent with no properly
functioning health systems, it is hard to imagine how adversely impactful a COVID-19 outbreak will be.
People are already extremely vulnerable to bear yet another distressing crisis. While all countries need to
respond to COVID-19, countries with existing humanitarian crisis coupled with weak governance are
particularly vulnerable. When COVID-19 affects countries with protracted humanitarian crises like
Somalia/land, vulnerable populations, particularly women headed households, the disabled and the
elderly living in overcrowded camps or informal urban settlements will be highly vulnerable to the disease
and its social and economic impacts unless support is given on preventative measures.The number of
people in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, around 5.2 million currently, will likely sharply
increase in the event of COVID-19 outbreak making the already fragile situation much worse. The Locust
infestation is another evolving crisis andif not addressed will also have significant impact on the food
security and livelihoods of the people.
COVID-19 crisis will have a different and far-reaching impact on poor people, especially the vulnerable.
Anyone can be exposed to the virus but the poor are most vulnerable as they lack financial and social
protections. Overcrowded IDP settlements and poor urban slums are also going to be the places where
disease can spread easily and quickly. To effectively address the urgent and acute humanitarian dimension
of the crisis, we need to frame that within our understanding of how inequality plays out. Women will be
as susceptible to getting infected by the virus but their need for support is greater because, as in any crisis,
women including elderly women, bear the greater responsibility of caring for the family and making both
ends meet. Women#s multiple burdens of needing to contribute to the household income while also taking
care of the young, theelderly and the sick mean they have the longest days, the shortest rest and the
highest stress, making them easy targets of disease.
Containment measures and their economic fallout are likely to hurt more than the disease itself, and for
longer. Restrictions on movement and market access will affect many households# income and coping
strategies in Somalia/land, including households who were relatively well off before the pandemic. As well
as short term support we need to consider howto provide support to those affected over the longer term.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE AND PROTECTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND WOMEN AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF COVID19 IN THE ZINDER AND DIFFA REGIONS
Like other countries in the world, Niger is also facing the COVID19 pandemic with more than 600 positive cases and fifteen deaths on April 20, 2020. To deal with the situation, the government has adopted a number of measures including, among others:
# a formal ban on all groups, particularly of a political, sporting and cultural nature;
# the closure of all schools and places of worship
# healthinsulation in Niamey and restrictions in the area of ##public transport
# etc.
Yet there is evidence that the containment measures chosen by the authorities, designed to limit human interactions, further deepen economic and social inequalities.
Indeed, according to the Oxfam report, &quot;the pandemic is threatening to increase gender inequality although the virus appears to kill more men than women&quot;. On the one hand, women represent:
# around 70% of health personnel worldwide, who are the most exposed to the virus;
# 92% of the informal workforce;
# 75% of unpaid care activities.

On the other hand, she states that containment measures lock women up in their homes, where they are not always safe, and moreover exposed to domestic violence.
Furthermore, when we take the young people constituting more than 70% of the population of Niger, studies carried out by the ILO establish that they are more prone to difficulties in continuing the courses (because outside the school system for the most part) and above all access decent work. In addition, they already constitute more than half of the informal workforce and are part of a fringe forced to work without any social or legal protection.
Faced with this situation, which undermines gender inequalities, Oxfam, in accordance with its mandate, cannot remain indifferent. As part of the response to COVID19, Oxfam in Niger intends to support the introduction of innovative initiatives carried out by young people and women to protect them from the impacts of COVID and build a sustainable dynamic of active citizenship against the pandemic.

The intervention logic aims to promote resilience and strengthen the protection of young people and women from COVID19 through the implementation of a research-action-advocacy initiative.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The world is currently facing a devastating scenario because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and all countries with confirmed cases are taking measures to react ranging from the lightest to the most severe to contain the transmission of the virus and protect people, especially to the most vulnerable.
The Mozambican government has also expressed its concerns in this regard and have put forward structural measures aimed at reducing the risk of infection by Covid-19. One of the measures taken was the declarationof State Emergency phase 3 as of 1 - 30 of April, then extended to 1 - 31 May 2020. The declaration of a state of emergency was accompanied by other related measures aimed at blocking the chain of contagion by Covid-19, such as the restriction of the number of people in the workplace, limitation of passengers number on public transport, obligation to wear masks in crowded places, closure of entertainment places,schools at all levels, among others.

The closure of schools, and social distance (includingconfinement of people at home), are in fact great measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in many rural communities in Mozambique, due to factorsassociated with poverty, access to information is limited. TV and the Internet isaccessible to a very limited group of people, which contributes to (i) exposure of communities to Covid-19, by ignoring disease prevention measures; (ii) Limits access to distance education for thousands of boys and (iii) girls and women may be exposed to situations of Gender Based Violence.

Oxfam Mozambique designed its response strategy to COVID-19 and has been looking for potential donors to materialize its activities. The Education Program for Active Citizenship and its partners is responsible  for implementing a part of this response strategy to Covid-19, during theschool closing period, by (i) disseminating Covid-19 prevention messages, (ii) piloting, together with local education authorities,radio-schools, to guarantee the right to education inthe face of Covid-19 and (iii) support youth organizations to prevention and  raise alert for Gender Based Violence  in context of COVID 19, due to women and girls confinement and permanent exposure.

Young women and men are a valuable resource and network during crises and public health emergencies. Through their informal and formal groupsand networks, they can help to break the chain of infection by working closely with their community, including the health authorities. Young people&apos;s involvement inthe COVID-19 response should be encouraged as they are drivers of change and educators in their communities and among their peers. In general, they are highly mobile, fast movers, entrepreneurs, innovators and users of various online communication and social media that can be used to mobilize people in responding to and preventing the COVID-19 pandemic.
Inspired on the above, Oxfam Mozambique intends, through youth engagement, to trigger actions in order to respond to 2 components of response to COVID-19 in two districts of Zambezia province, specifically Mocuba district through our local implementing partner NANA and Nocoadala through aour Local youth implanting partner ARZ (Associa&#xE7;&#xE3;o das Raparigas da Zambezia)

The management of the project on the ground will be under the leadership of NANA, which will ensure the mobilization of young people to engage in community awareness campaigns to prevent Covid-19. NANA will also work in partnership with another youth organization, ARZ, to join efforts to prevent and report potential situations of gender-based violence at the community level. Relevant stakeholders such as community authorities and district services will also be involved in the implementation of this initiative to ensure ownership and continuity.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>

Besidesthe partnerships and collaborations with relevant social actors which improved our capacity, we have in keeping with our peopled-led and participatory approach provided both men and women boys and girls space to freely participate in the identifying of gaps and designing of solutions, through the holding of inclusive Peace intercultural dialogues and training workshops training over 180 (F=37%) Peace Ambassadors who actively engaged in their local communities, schools and on various social media platforms have inspired hundreds of their peers to take on peace and responsible social media use advocacy roles.

The principal geographic areas of operation of Community Empowerment for Creative Innovation mainly are Koboko District and the refugee camp settlements of Bidibidi refugee camp settlement.

The specific target groups can be defined broadly as follows:

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?
The environment Community Empowerment for Creative Innovation (CECI) works in is diverse in cultures and ethnicity and is also characterised with some form of fear, ethnic divisions and violent conflicts, intolerance among others, besides being thickly populated by youth who, most suffered adversely armed conflicts, are traumatized,hopeless and idle.

Apart from government and business, other relevant social actors include church, associations/groups, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and institutions. These play roles that range from maintaining law and order, providing relief and humanitarian assistance, educational support, psychosocial and health care to social advocacy.

As the culture of CECI is to work always with the community and other relevant social actors such as earlier identified is in position to influence great positive change, inconsiderate of the closeness of the CECI to the community and the speaking of a common language used by the very diversecommunities we#re committed to serve as well as the diversity of the CECI team and its good relationship with the community, church, CBO/CSOs, and its better understanding of how the community feels.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. HISTORY:
          Community Action for Transformation or CAFOT is started in August of 2017 desired to engage the refugees youth in particular and the host community in comprehensive peace building, Hygiene and sanitation promotion and advocating for a quality education as a mean of building resilience and health living among the south Sudanese and host communities. The organization was started by a group of young people with the vision; to create a safe and peaceful atmosphere for human race including his God-given plan, domestic and wild- life and to deliver socio-economic development. So far the organization has improved since its formation andit also has taken gender mainstreaming as co in achieving its vision through programming, planning, andimplementation.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS:
       So far there is a resilient building among the refugee and the host community through the public forums that CAFOT already carried on since the beginning of 2018.
There is trust building among the young people, youth are already getting into groups to start up small business as a means to fight poverty and building a stronger relationship
Through our established school, the children are progressively moving in a right direction to face the future, this is meantto ensure illiteracy in removed completely in our society.
3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE:
Mission:  To see a reduced rate of the prevailing trauma, conflict and to build a health livingamong the refugees and host communities by provision of education, creation of awareness on hygiene and sanitation through participatory drama (forum theatre) and music.
  a. Institutional objectives:
1. To Open Adult literacy classes, Nursery and lower primary classes
2. To empower the rural women by providing trainingson basic business entrepreneurship skills, and creation of income generating activities
3. To create a flat form for communities to interact on societal issues that affect their living and adopt on the dynamics of the modern change as relates to positive resilience in community development.
4. To promote Hygiene and sanitation, as wellas unity, equality with gender sensitivity, justice and everlasting peace in the community through advocacy and other measures where necessary
5. To create awareness oncorruption, gender-based violence, promote leadership and good governance
6. To promote social understanding among, youth, women, elderly, children and families as a whole, through creation of forum theatre, debates and dialogue this gives them an opportunity to share their own experiences
7. To build the capacities of organized youth groups, drama groups, women associations, RWCs, religious leaders, Boda Boda associations, Taxi Drivers and brokers association, Market management committee, football clubs, local artists, water management committees, Hygiene promoters, Village girl child education promoters (VGCEP) among others through networking meetings and trainings to increase awareness to the grass root

   a). Field(s) of activity:
         1. Education: We use Physical education which is an integral part of educational program design to promote the optimum development of an individual physically, socially, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually through total body movement in the performance of properly selected physical activities. It is a process by which changes in the individual are brought about through movement#s experiences and it aims not only at physical development but is also concerned with education of the whole person through physical activities.
       2. Hygiene and sanitation: Sanitation refers to public health conditions related to clean drinking water and adequate treatment and disposal of human excreta and sewage. Preventing human contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal#oral route. For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stuntedgrowth in children, can be reduced through sanitation. There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low levels of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, trachoma, to name just a few
      3. Peace building awareness programs: Peacebuilding is an activity that aims to resolve injustice in nonviolent ways and to transform the cultural &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; structural conditions that generate deadly or destructive conflict. It revolves around developing constructive personal, group, and political relationships across ethnic, religious, class, national, and racial boundaries. This process includes violence prevention; conflict management, resolution, or transformation; and post-conflict reconciliation or trauma healing, i.e., before, during and after war.
We are currently in Imvepi refugee settlement, but with a plan to reach Rhino and Bidibidi settlements
Who are the social actors that benefit from the work? We target youth, (men, women, girls and boys)
4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING:
       We work directly with the office of the prime minster who is a principle representative of the government on ground, the church leaders, and local chiefs andalready established associations including the line ministries. These actors are supporters of our programs and they act like technical advisors in the day today running of community activities.
5. FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATIONAL CHART
       In the current board of director, out of seven members, the three are female. We have the Director who is a male and the program manager, while the position of the finance is a female , While the community mobilisers are a mixture of both male and female altogether.
6.CURRENT BALANCE SHEET/FINANCIAL POSITION
       We have not yet received much funding as a newly established organization apart from being funded on activities basis. This means we always relay on the contribution of our members and the volunteers.</narrative>
